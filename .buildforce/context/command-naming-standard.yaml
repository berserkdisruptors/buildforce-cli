summary: |
  Standardized slash command naming convention using /buildforce.* prefix across all
  user-facing documentation, templates, and code. Ensures namespace isolation and prevents
  command name collisions across multiple AI assistant platforms.

responsibilities:
  - Enforce consistent /buildforce.* prefix for all five core commands
  - Prevent command naming inconsistencies in documentation and templates
  - Maintain namespace isolation via buildforce. prefix pattern
  - Ensure user-facing content displays correct command syntax

design_decisions:
  - decision: "Use /buildforce.* prefix for all slash commands"
    rationale: |
      Provides namespace isolation without subdirectory nesting. Flat structure simplifies
      discovery while preventing naming conflicts. Documented in cli-architecture.yaml:136.
      Dot notation is intuitive and widely recognized in CLI systems.

  - decision: "Prioritize user-facing files for naming consistency"
    rationale: |
      README.md and src/commands/examples.ts directly impact user experience and onboarding.
      Inconsistent command references in these files cause confusion and reduce trust in
      documentation accuracy.

  - decision: "Update templates to guide AI agent behavior"
    rationale: |
      Template files (commands/*.md, *.yaml) guide AI agent execution. Consistent command
      references in templates ensure agents use correct syntax when presenting instructions
      to users or executing workflows.

  - decision: "Preserve historical spec folders as immutable archives"
    rationale: |
      Completed spec folders document work as it was done. Updating historical references
      would compromise archive integrity and create confusion about what commands were
      actually used during that implementation.

canonical_commands:
  - /buildforce.research: "Gather context from project knowledge, codebase, and external sources"
  - /buildforce.plan: "Define requirements and create structured specification with implementation plan"
  - /buildforce.build: "Execute implementation following spec and plan with progress tracking"
  - /buildforce.complete: "Finalize spec by creating context files and clearing spec state"
  - /buildforce.document: "Document existing functionality without full spec-driven workflow"

evolution:
  - version: "1.0"
    date: "2025-11-21"
    changes: |
      Initial enforcement of /buildforce.* naming standard across codebase.
      Updated 9 files outside .buildforce/ to use consistent command prefix.
      Eliminated all old unprefixed command references (/plan, /build, /complete, /document, /research).

notes: |
  This standard addresses technical debt from incomplete command rename transitions.
  The buildforce. prefix provides protection against command name collisions across
  11 different AI assistant platforms (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI,
  GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Kilo Code, Roo Code, Auggie CLI, and others).

  Files within .buildforce/ folder are excluded from this standard to preserve
  historical accuracy in archive artifacts. Context files may use old command
  references when documenting legacy implementations.

  Pattern validation:
  - User-facing files (README, CLI output) must use /buildforce.* format
  - Template files must use /buildforce.* in context descriptions and comments
  - Historical spec folders remain unchanged as point-in-time snapshots

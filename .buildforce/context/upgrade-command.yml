summary: |
  Slash command for upgrading existing BuildForce projects to the latest templates, scripts,
  and slash commands while preserving user-created content (context repository and specs).
  Automatically detects project configuration and supports selective override via flags.

responsibilities:
  - Upgrade slash commands, templates, and scripts to latest versions from GitHub Releases
  - Preserve user-created content (.buildforce/context/ and .buildforce/specs/)
  - Auto-detect AI assistant and script type from buildforce.json configuration
  - Support configuration overrides via --ai and --script flags
  - Provide dry-run mode to preview changes before applying
  - Display upgrade progress with clear status indicators
  - Update buildforce.json with version metadata after successful upgrade
  - Implement atomic operations with rollback on failure
  - Handle backward compatibility with projects initialized by older CLI versions

design_decisions:
  - decision: "Store aiAssistant and scriptType in buildforce.json"
    rationale: "Enables upgrade command to auto-detect project configuration without re-prompting users. Single source of truth for project settings."

  - decision: "Preserve .buildforce/context/ and .buildforce/specs/ entirely"
    rationale: "User-created content must never be modified during upgrade. These directories contain accumulated project knowledge and active work that represents significant user investment."

  - decision: "Support --ai and --script override flags"
    rationale: "Allows users to switch AI assistants or script types during upgrade without manually editing buildforce.json. Provides flexibility for migration scenarios."

  - decision: "Implement atomic operations with rollback on failure"
    rationale: "Prevents partial upgrades that leave project in broken state. Use temporary directory for extraction, then atomic file operations with backup/restore capability."

  - decision: "Reuse init command infrastructure (download, extract, step tracking)"
    rationale: "Reduces code duplication and ensures consistent behavior. The core file operations are identical between init and upgrade, only the target directories differ."

  - decision: "Add --dry-run flag for preview mode"
    rationale: "Standard CLI pattern. Allows users to see what would change before committing to upgrade, reducing anxiety about overwriting files."

  - decision: "Prompt for missing configuration in backward compatibility mode"
    rationale: "Projects initialized before this feature lack aiAssistant/scriptType in buildforce.json. Interactive prompts collect missing values and update configuration."

  Upgrade Process:

  1. Validation Phase (validation.ts):
     - validateUpgradePrerequisites() - Check buildforce.json exists
     - Check .buildforce/ directory exists
     - Validate buildforce.json is valid JSON
     - Fail gracefully with clear error messages

  2. Configuration Detection (index.ts):
     - Read buildforce.json configuration
     - Extract aiAssistant and scriptType fields
     - Handle missing fields (backward compatibility)
     - Apply override flags (--ai, --script) if provided
     - Prompt user for missing configuration interactively
     - Update buildforce.json with selections

  3. Template Download (execution.ts):
     - Reuse downloadTemplateFromGithub() from init
     - Fetch latest template ZIP from GitHub Releases
     - Extract to temporary directory
     - Validate template structure

  4. Selective File Replacement (execution.ts):
     - Create backups of existing files before replacement
     - Replace slash commands in AI assistant folder (e.g., .claude/commands/)
     - Replace templates in .buildforce/templates/
     - Replace scripts in .buildforce/scripts/
     - SKIP .buildforce/context/ (preserve user context)
     - SKIP .buildforce/specs/ (preserve user specifications)
     - Use atomic file operations (backup → replace → cleanup)

  5. Rollback Mechanism (execution.ts):
     - Monitor each operation for errors
     - If any step fails, restore from backups
     - Clean up temporary files
     - Report failure with detailed error message

  6. Finalization (execution.ts):
     - Update buildforce.json with version metadata
     - Remove backups if upgrade successful
     - Clean up temporary directory
     - Display success summary

  Dry-Run Mode:
  - Log what would be updated (files, directories)
  - Show configuration that would be used
  - Exit before making any changes
  - No temporary files or backups created

      - "Add progress tracking using StepTracker"
      - "Update buildforce.json with version metadata after upgrade"
    validation: "Upgrade replaces commands, templates, scripts but preserves context and specs"

  phase_4:
    name: "Error Handling and Atomicity"
    tasks:
      - "Implement temporary directory extraction with atomic file replacement"
      - "Add rollback logic for failed upgrades"
      - "Add comprehensive error messages for common failures"
      - "Add backward compatibility for projects without aiAssistant/scriptType"
    validation: "Failed upgrades rollback successfully with clear error messages"

key_features:
  safety:
    - "Never modifies .buildforce/context/ (user-created knowledge)"
    - "Never modifies .buildforce/specs/ (user specifications)"
    - "Atomic operations with rollback on failure"
    - "Backup mechanism before replacing files"
    - "Dry-run mode to preview changes"

  convenience:
    - "Auto-detects project configuration from buildforce.json"
    - "Supports override flags for switching AI assistants or script types"
    - "Progress tracking with step-by-step status"
    - "Backward compatibility with older projects"
    - "Interactive prompts for missing configuration"

  reliability:
    - "Validation checks before making changes"
    - "Clear error messages for all failure scenarios"
    - "Network failure handling"
    - "Disk space validation"
    - "Version metadata tracking in buildforce.json"

edge_cases_handled:
  - "Project initialized before this feature (buildforce.json missing aiAssistant/scriptType) → Interactive prompts collect missing values"
  - "Corrupted buildforce.json → Clear JSON parsing error with file path"
  - "Missing AI assistant folder despite configuration → Creates folder structure during upgrade"
  - "Network failures during download → Rollback with clear error message"
  - "Disk space issues → Early validation prevents partial writes"
  - "User has modified template files → Backup mechanism preserves originals, allows manual diff/restore"

evolution:
  - version: "1.0"
    date: "2025-10-28"
    changes: "Initial implementation with auto-detection, dry-run mode, atomic operations, and backward compatibility"

notes: |
  The upgrade command is a critical feature for maintaining BuildForce projects over time.
  It enables users to benefit from:
  - New slash command features and improvements
  - Bug fixes in templates and scripts
  - Enhanced workflow capabilities
  - Security updates

  Without the upgrade command, users would need to manually copy files or re-initialize
  their projects, risking loss of accumulated context and specifications.

  Key design trade-offs:
  - Simplicity over flexibility: No version-specific migrations, just upgrade to latest
  - Safety over convenience: Always preserve user content, even if it means manual merges
  - Transparency over automation: Show what will change (dry-run) before making changes

  Future enhancements:
  - Add --backup flag to create timestamped backup before upgrade
  - Add version checking to warn users if newer CLI version available
  - Implement migration scripts for handling breaking changes between major versions
  - Support selective upgrades (--only-commands, --only-templates, --only-scripts)
  - Create upgrade diff report showing exactly what changed

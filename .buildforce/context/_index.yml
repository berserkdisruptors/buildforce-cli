# ============================================================================
# CONTEXT INDEX FIELD DOCUMENTATION
# ============================================================================
#
# Each context entry in the index has the following fields:
#
# REQUIRED FIELDS:
# ----------------
# - id (string, kebab-case):
#     Unique identifier matching the context filename (without .yml extension)
#     Must be unique across all entries in this index
#     Example: "authentication", "build-command", "error-handling"
#
# - file (string):
#     Context filename (must match id field with .yml extension)
#     Example: "authentication.yml", "build-command.yml"
#
# - type (enum):
#     Category of the context for organization
#     Valid values: module | feature | component | pattern
#       - module: High-level system module (e.g., authentication, payment)
#       - feature: Specific feature within a module (e.g., OAuth login)
#       - component: Reusable UI or code component
#       - pattern: Design pattern or architectural decision
#     Example: "feature"
#
# OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED FIELDS:
# ---------------------------------
# - description (string, max 100 chars):
#     Short one-liner summary of what this context represents
#     Improves searchability without opening the file
#     Example: "JWT-based authentication with OAuth2 social login support"
#
# - tags (array of strings):
#     Searchable keywords for discovery
#     Use relevant terms related to functionality, technology, domain
#     Example: [auth, security, jwt, oauth2]
#
# - related_context (array of context IDs, OPTIONAL):
#     Array of context IDs that are closely related to this context
#     Enables agents to discover related contexts through explicit cross-references
#
#     **When to populate:**
#       - Feature families (e.g., all slash commands reference slash-commands)
#       - Dependent modules (e.g., build-command depends on plan-template)
#       - Sibling features (e.g., research and document commands work together)
#
#     **Usage guidelines:**
#       - Only include contexts that are closely related or have direct dependencies
#       - Avoid over-populating—focus on significant relationships
#       - IDs must exist in this _index.yml file (no validation enforced)
#       - Bidirectional relationships recommended for discoverability
#         (if A references B, B should reference A)
#
#     Example: [plan-template, iterate-plan-command, spec-command]

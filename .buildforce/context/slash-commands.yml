summary: |
  Spec-driven development workflow implemented via 5 slash commands.
  Guides build agents through Research � Spec � Plan � Build � Complete lifecycle.
  Commands are instruction templates that enhance user queries with workflow-specific context.

responsibilities:
  - Context gathering and project knowledge retrieval (RESEARCH - see research-slash-command.yml for details)
  - Intent materialization into specifications (SPEC)
  - Implementation planning and design decisions (PLAN)
  - Guided implementation with progress tracking and deviation logging (BUILD - see build-slash-command.yml for details)
  - Final validation and completion confirmation (COMPLETE)

dependencies:
  internal:
    - context-repository: "RESEARCH searches .buildforce/context/_index.yml for accumulated knowledge"
  external:
    - None (pure instruction templates for Claude Code)

files:
  primary:
    - src/templates/commands/research.md
    - src/templates/commands/spec.md
    - src/templates/commands/plan.md
    - src/templates/commands/build.md
    - src/templates/commands/complete.md
  secondary:
    - .buildforce/context/_index.yml (searched by RESEARCH)

workflow:
  sequence:
    - command: "/research"
      purpose: "Gather context for spec-driven development session"
      input: "User query (what to research)"
      output: "Structured report with project context, file paths, architecture diagrams, data models"
      key_features:
        - "Searches .buildforce/context/_index.yml first (accumulated knowledge)"
        - "Detects recency indicators � uses web search"
        - "Produces Mermaid diagrams for codebase queries"
        - "Explicit file path lists (saves manual @ references)"

    - command: "/spec"
      purpose: "Materialize user intent into specification (WHAT to build)"
      input: "User intent (the concrete incremental change)"
      output: "Specification document with requirements, scope, edge cases, data models"
      key_features:
        - "Validates prerequisite context (suggests /research if needed)"
        - "Asks up to 3 clarifying questions if intent is vague"
        - "Ensures requirements are testable and measurable"
        - "Prevents premature HOW decisions"

    - command: "/plan"
      purpose: "Design implementation approach (HOW to build)"
      input: "Planning instructions/constraints (optional)"
      output: "Implementation plan with architecture, design decisions, numbered steps, testing strategy"
      key_features:
        - "Requires prior /spec command"
        - "Justifies all technology/library choices"
        - "References specific file paths in steps"
        - "Validates plan aligns with all spec requirements"

    - command: "/build"
      purpose: "Execute implementation following spec+plan"
      input: "Iteration-specific instructions (optional)"
      output: "Implementation + deviation log + testing guidance"
      key_features:
        - "Executes `.buildforce/scripts/bash/get-spec-paths.sh --json` for FEATURE_DIR discovery"
        - "Loads spec.yml and plan.yml from FEATURE_DIR into context"
        - "Tracks progress step-by-step with visible checklist"
        - "Logs deviations from original plan (e.g., library swaps)"
        - "Validates against BOTH spec requirements AND plan adherence"
        - "Verifies code quality (compiles, tests pass, no obvious gaps)"
        - "Provides testing guidance (what to test, how to test, test results)"
        - "Supports multiple iterations with refinement"

    - command: "/complete"
      purpose: "Finalize feature and validate intent match"
      input: "None (optional final notes)"
      output: "Completion report with validation, deviations, files modified"
      key_features:
        - "Validates all spec requirements implemented"
        - "Reviews deviation log across all /build iterations"
        - "Generates comprehensive completion report"
        - "Requires explicit user confirmation"

design_principles:
  - "Compact but powerful: Enhance user queries without teaching build agents HOW to work"
  - "Context-first: Always search project context repository before other research"
  - "Incremental: Focus on single, focused changes, not complete rewrites"
  - "Traceable: Log deviations, track progress, validate against spec"
  - "Iterative: Support refinement at every stage (spec, plan, build)"

evolution:
  - version: "1.0"

    changes: "Initial implementation of 5-command workflow with project context search"

  - version: "1.1"
    date: "2025-10-08"
    changes: "Completed BUILD command with 7 guidelines, script-based discovery, dual validation, testing guidance (29 lines, 75% reduction)"

notes: |
  Inspired by @spec-kit workflow but simplified to 5 commands.
  Key innovation: .buildforce/context repository as primary knowledge source.
  RESEARCH command is foundationprovides context for all subsequent commands.
  Each command expects $ARGUMENTS (Claude Code compatible).

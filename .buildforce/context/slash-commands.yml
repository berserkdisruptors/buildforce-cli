summary: |
  Spec-driven development workflow implemented via 5 core slash commands plus 1 utility command.
  Core workflow: Research → Spec → Plan → Build → Complete lifecycle.
  Utility: Document command for creating context files without specs.
  Commands are instruction templates that enhance user queries with workflow-specific context.
  All commands now follow proven compact pattern with numbered guidelines and script-based discovery.

responsibilities:
  - Context gathering and project knowledge retrieval (RESEARCH - see research-slash-command.yml for details, 27 lines)
  - Intent materialization into specifications (SPEC - 97 lines)
  - Implementation planning and design decisions (PLAN - see 004-iterate-plan-command.yml for details, 40 lines)
  - Guided implementation with progress tracking and deviation logging (BUILD - see 002-build-command.yml for details, 32 lines)
  - Final validation and completion confirmation (COMPLETE - 44 lines)
  - Context file creation for existing functionality without specs (DOCUMENT - see 005-new-document-slash.yml for details, 29 lines)

dependencies:
  internal:
    - context-repository: "RESEARCH searches .buildforce/context/_index.yml for accumulated knowledge; DOCUMENT creates/updates context files; COMPLETE generates context files for completed specs"
  external:
    - None (pure instruction templates for Claude Code)

files:
  primary:
    - src/templates/commands/research.md
    - src/templates/commands/spec.md

workflow:
  sequence:
    - command: "/research"
      purpose: "Gather context for spec-driven development session"
      input: "User query (what to research)"
      output: "Structured report with project context, file paths, architecture diagrams, data models"
      key_features:
        - "Searches .buildforce/context/_index.yml first (accumulated knowledge)"
        - "Detects recency indicators � uses web search"
        - "Produces Mermaid diagrams for codebase queries"
        - "Explicit file path lists (saves manual @ references)"

    - command: "/spec"
      purpose: "Materialize user intent into specification (WHAT to build)"
      input: "User intent (the concrete incremental change)"
      output: "Specification document with requirements, scope, edge cases, data models"
      key_features:
        - "Validates prerequisite context (suggests /research if needed)"
        - "Asks up to 3 clarifying questions if intent is vague"
        - "Ensures requirements are testable and measurable"
        - "Prevents premature HOW decisions"

    - command: "/plan"
      purpose: "Design implementation approach (HOW to build)"
      input: "Planning instructions/constraints (optional)"
      output: "Implementation plan with architecture, design decisions, phases with tasks, testing strategy"
      key_features:
        - "Executes `.buildforce/scripts/bash/get-spec-paths.sh --json` for SPEC_DIR discovery"
        - "Loads spec.yaml into context (NEVER proceeds without it)"
        - "Uses 7 numbered guidelines (Script Execution, Parse Instructions, Design Decisions, Generate Plan, Validate, Present, Request Approval)"
        - "Generates plan.yaml with plan-template.yaml v1.0 structure (phases, tasks with checkboxes/spec_refs/files)"
        - "Completely replaces plan.yaml on every run (no iteration tracking)"
        - "Presents plan in fixed format with 6 sections (Architecture, Decisions, Files, Phases, Testing, Risks)"
        - "Includes ALL task details in output (checkboxes, spec_refs, files) to prevent hallucination"
        - "Asks user for approval/feedback before suggesting /build"
        - "Supports iterative refinement via multiple /plan calls"

    - command: "/build"

      input: "Iteration-specific instructions (optional)"
      output: "Implementation + deviation log + testing guidance"
      key_features:
        - "Executes `.buildforce/scripts/bash/get-spec-paths.sh --json` for FEATURE_DIR discovery"
        - "Loads spec.yml and plan.yml from FEATURE_DIR into context"
        - "Tracks progress step-by-step with visible checklist"
        - "Logs deviations from original plan (e.g., library swaps)"
        - "Validates against BOTH spec requirements AND plan adherence"
        - "Verifies code quality (compiles, tests pass, no obvious gaps)"
        - "Provides testing guidance (what to test, how to test, test results)"
        - "Supports multiple iterations with refinement"

    - command: "/complete"
      purpose: "Finalize feature and validate intent match"
      input: "None (optional final notes)"
      output: "Completion report with validation, deviations, files modified"
      key_features:
        - "Validates all spec requirements implemented"
        - "Reviews deviation log across all /build iterations"
        - "Generates comprehensive completion report"
        - "Requires explicit user confirmation"

  utility_commands:
    - command: "/document"
      purpose: "Create or update context files for existing functionality without specs"
      input: "Topic or module to document (information assumed in context window)"
      output: "Context file + _index.yml update + related context updates"
      key_features:
        - "Operates independently of spec-driven workflow (no spec/plan/build required)"
        - "Template-only (no script execution like /research)"
        - "Auto-detects context type (module/feature/component/pattern)"
        - "Generates snake-case filenames (2-3 words, NO numeric prefixes)"
        - "Detects and resolves ID conflicts automatically"

        - "Automatically updates related context files with cross-references"
        - "Uses 7 numbered guidelines with ALWAYS/NEVER emphasis (29 lines)"

design_principles:
  - "Compact but powerful: Enhance user queries without teaching build agents HOW to work"
  - "Context-first: Always search project context repository before other research"
  - "Incremental: Focus on single, focused changes, not complete rewrites"
  - "Traceable: Log deviations, track progress, validate against spec"
  - "Iterative: Support refinement at every stage (spec, plan, build)"

notes: |
  Inspired by @spec-kit workflow but simplified to 5 core commands + 1 utility command.
  Key innovation: .buildforce/context repository as primary knowledge source.
  RESEARCH command is foundationprovides context for all subsequent commands.
  Each command expects $ARGUMENTS (Claude Code compatible).

  Compression achievements (v2.1):
  - /research: 27 lines (68% reduction) - 7 guidelines ✅
  - /spec: 97 lines (iterated with structured workflow) ✅
  - /plan: 40 lines (74.5% reduction) - 7 guidelines ✅
  - /build: 32 lines (75% reduction) - 7 guidelines ✅
  - /complete: 44 lines (iterated with structured workflow) ✅
  - /document: 29 lines - 7 guidelines ✅ (new utility command)

  All commands following proven compact pattern:
  - YAML frontmatter with script execution (where applicable)
  - User input section with $ARGUMENTS
  - Context explanation
  - Numbered guidelines (RESEARCH/PLAN/BUILD/DOCUMENT use 7 guidelines)
  - ALWAYS/NEVER bold emphasis for critical instructions
  - No verbose HOW-TO explanations
  - Context reference at bottom

  System now production-ready with complete 5-command core workflow + 1 utility command.

  /document vs /complete context creation:
  - /complete: Creates context files for specs completed through full workflow (research → spec → plan → build → complete)
  - /document: Creates context files for existing functionality WITHOUT specs (legacy code, discovered patterns, architectural decisions)
  - Both follow _schema.yml structure, update _index.yml, maintain cross-references
  - /research reads context, /document writes context (natural complement)

quality_standards:
  - standard: "No automated tests exist"
    description: |
      This project currently has NO automated testing infrastructure.
      The package.json test script explicitly returns an error: "Error: no test specified".
      All verification must be done manually through local execution and manual review.
    enforcement: reference
    confidence: 1.0

  - standard: "TypeScript strict mode"
    description: |
      TypeScript is configured with strict: true, noImplicitReturns: true, and
      noFallthroughCasesInSwitch: true. This provides compile-time type safety
      as the primary form of static analysis.
    enforcement: strict
    confidence: 1.0

test_expectations:

known_risks:
  - module: "src/**/*.ts"
    risk: "No automated test coverage exists for any module"
    mitigation: |
      Manual testing required before merge. Run `npm run dev` to test changes locally.
      Build verification via `npm run build` ensures TypeScript compilation succeeds.

  - module: "package.json"
    risk: "Test script is a placeholder that always fails"
    mitigation: |
      Do not run `npm test` expecting it to validate changes.
      Use manual verification and TypeScript build checks instead.

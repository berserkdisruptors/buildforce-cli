    description: |
      This file documents known risks, gaps, and areas requiring extra attention.
      Agents should reference this before making changes to affected modules.
    enforcement: reference
    confidence: 1.0

known_risks:
  - module: "src/**/*.ts"
    risk: "No automated test coverage"
    mitigation: |
      All code changes must be manually verified. When making changes:
      1. Run `npm run build` to verify TypeScript compilation
      2. Run `npm run dev` to test the CLI locally
      3. Test affected commands manually in a real project
      Testing infrastructure is a known gap - contributions welcome.

  - module: "src/**/*.ts"
    risk: "No linting enforcement"
    mitigation: |
      No ESLint or Prettier configuration at project level.
      Code style consistency relies on TypeScript strict mode and manual review.
      Consider running IDE-level linting during development.

  - module: ".github/workflows/release.yml"
    risk: "Automatic release on main branch pushes"
    mitigation: |
      Merging to main automatically creates a new release if key paths are modified.
      This is intentional for rapid iteration but means:
      - Every merge should be release-ready
      - Version bumping is automatic (patch increment)
      - Breaking changes require manual version management

  - module: "package.json"
    risk: "Node.js 18+ requirement not enforced in CI"
    mitigation: |
      engines.node specifies >=18.0.0 but no CI check validates this.
      Development should target Node.js 18 as minimum supported version.

  - module: "src/commands/**/*.ts"
    risk: "No error boundary or crash reporting"
    mitigation: |
      CLI commands may fail without helpful error messages in edge cases.
      When encountering errors, check:
      - File permissions
      - Network connectivity (for GitHub operations)
      - Valid project structure

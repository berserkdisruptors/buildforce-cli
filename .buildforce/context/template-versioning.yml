summary: |
  Automatic version injection system for BuildForce templates during GitHub release workflow.
  Implements pre-release commit strategy that versions all template files (spec, plan, research,
  and command templates) with semantic version matching the release tag. Ensures distributed
  template packages are self-describing and version-aware, enabling traceability and future
  upgrade tooling. Uses bash scripting for YAML manipulation with full idempotency support.

responsibilities:
  - Automatically inject version numbers into all template files during release process
  - Create pre-release version bump commit with [skip ci] flag to prevent workflow loops
  - Update 9 template files (3 YAML templates + 6 markdown command templates) with version field
  - Ensure distributed release packages contain templates matching release tag version
  - Maintain idempotent script behavior for safe re-execution
  - Preserve template structure and content while updating version field only

dependencies:
  internal:
    - release-workflow: "Integrated into .github/workflows/release.yml between version calculation and package creation"
    - template-structure: "All templates must support version field in YAML frontmatter or as first YAML field"
    - cli-architecture: "Templates distributed via GitHub releases are consumed by buildforce init command"
  external:
    - bash: "Scripting language for update-template-versions.sh"
    - awk: "YAML manipulation for pure YAML files (cross-platform compatibility)"
    - sed: "YAML frontmatter manipulation for markdown files"
    - git: "Commit and push version bump changes to main branch"
    - github-actions: "Workflow orchestration and GITHUB_TOKEN for authenticated pushes"

files:
  primary:
    - .github/workflows/scripts/update-template-versions.sh
    - .github/workflows/release.yml
    - .github/workflows/scripts/get-next-version.sh
  secondary:
    - src/templates/spec-template.yaml
    - src/templates/plan-template.yaml
    - src/templates/research-template.yml
    - src/templates/commands/plan.md
    - src/templates/commands/plan.md
    - src/templates/commands/build.md
    - src/templates/commands/complete.md
    - src/templates/commands/document.md
    - src/templates/commands/research.md

design_decisions:
  - decision: "Use awk for updating version fields in pure YAML files instead of sed"
    rationale: "macOS sed doesn't support '0,/pattern/s//' syntax for first-occurrence-only replacement. Awk provides portable cross-platform behavior and better control over first-match replacement logic."

  - decision: "Separate update functions for pure YAML vs markdown with YAML frontmatter"
    rationale: "Template files have two distinct formats: pure YAML (spec, plan, research) and markdown with YAML frontmatter delimited by --- (command templates). Separate functions provide clearer logic and better error handling for each format type."

  - decision: "Version format uses semantic version without 'v' prefix (0.1.0 not v0.1.0)"
    rationale: "YAML frontmatter typically uses clean semver format. The 'v' prefix is for git tags, not for version metadata. This keeps templates cleaner and more professional while workflow strips 'v' from tag before calling script."

  - decision: "Place version field as first field in YAML (immediately after opening --- for frontmatter)"
    rationale: "Placing version as the very first field makes it immediately visible when opening templates and ensures maximum consistency across all templates. Users can quickly identify template version at a glance."

  - decision: "Use [skip ci] in commit message to prevent infinite workflow loops"
    rationale: "Version bump commits should not trigger new workflow runs. The [skip ci] flag is a GitHub Actions convention that prevents infinite loop scenario where version bump triggers workflow which bumps version again."

  - decision: "Script is idempotent - skips update if version already matches target"
    rationale: "Idempotency prevents unnecessary git changes and allows safe re-runs. If version already matches, no changes are made, resulting in clean git status. Critical for workflow reliability and debugging."

  - decision: "Version bump placed after get-next-version, before release package creation in workflow"
    rationale: "This placement ensures version is calculated first from git tags, templates are updated with that version, changes are committed and pushed, and then release package creation proceeds with the versioned commit as the source."

  - decision: "Implement increment-until-unused version calculation to prevent version collisions"
    rationale: "Workflow can run multiple times on same commit (manual re-runs, workflow_dispatch), causing multiple sequential releases pointing to same commit. Version calculation now loops incrementing patch version until finding an unused tag, ensuring every workflow run creates a release without skipping."

  - decision: "Remove check-release-exists workflow step"
    rationale: "The check-release-exists step was causing releases to be skipped when version collisions occurred. Since get-next-version.sh now guarantees unused versions via increment loop, this check is redundant and harmful. All release creation steps now run unconditionally."

evolution:
  - version: "1.0"
    date: "2025-11-03"
    changes: |
      Initial implementation of automatic template versioning:
      - Created update-template-versions.sh script with dual-format support
      - Integrated version bump into release.yml workflow (3 new steps)
      - Added version field to all 9 template files
      - Implemented idempotency with version matching checks
      - Added comprehensive error handling and validation
      - Tested locally with versions 0.0.97, 0.0.98, 0.0.99

      Key features:
      - Handles pure YAML files and markdown with YAML frontmatter
      - Version validation with semver regex
      - Skips files already at target version (idempotent)
      - Exits with error if no templates found or invalid version
      - Uses awk for portable YAML manipulation
      - Integrates seamlessly with existing release workflow

  - version: "1.1"
    date: "2025-11-04"
    changes: |
      Fixed release workflow version collision bug:
      - Enhanced get-next-version.sh with increment-until-unused logic
      - Added version_tag_exists() function using git tag -l for tag checking
      - Implemented while loop that increments patch version until finding unused version
      - Added max iteration limit of 100 with clear error message
      - Added informational logging for debugging re-runs
      - Removed check-release-exists workflow step that was causing skips
      - Removed all conditional execution from release creation steps
      - All workflow steps now run unconditionally

      Root cause:
      - Workflow could run multiple times on same commit (manual re-runs, workflow_dispatch)
      - Multiple sequential releases created pointing to same commit (e.g., v0.0.23 and v0.0.24 both at commit 781a15b)
      - git describe returned alphabetically first tag when multiple existed
      - check-release-exists detected collision and skipped release creation

      Solution:
      - Version calculation now guarantees unused version before any template updates
      - Every workflow run creates a release regardless of how many times it's executed
      - Workflow is resilient to re-runs with predictable versioning behavior

notes: |
  This implementation provides a solid foundation for template versioning and enables
  future upgrade tooling. Users running `buildforce init` will receive templates with
  version information, making it possible to:

  - Identify which release version a project was initialized from
  - Provide better support and troubleshooting guidance
  - Make informed decisions about when to upgrade templates
  - Build automatic upgrade detection and migration tools

  The [skip ci] flag is critical to prevent infinite loops where the version bump commit
  triggers another workflow run, which would bump the version again, ad infinitum.

  The script's idempotency makes it safe for debugging and re-execution. If templates
  already have the target version, the script reports this and exits successfully without
  making any changes.

  Version collision fix (v1.1):
  The increment-until-unused logic in get-next-version.sh ensures that every workflow run
  creates a release, even when the workflow is manually re-run or triggered multiple times
  on the same commit. This was critical to fix a bug where releases were being skipped when
  version numbers collided. The workflow is now resilient to any number of re-runs with
  predictable sequential versioning (v0.0.25, v0.0.26, v0.0.27, etc.).

  The max iteration limit of 100 provides a safety net against infinite loops while being
  far beyond realistic scenarios. In practice, most workflows will find an unused version
  within 1-3 iterations.

  Future enhancements could include:
  - PowerShell variant of the update script (NFR4 currently out of scope)
  - Individual template versioning if templates evolve at different rates
  - Version compatibility checks or breaking change detection
  - Automatic changelog generation based on version bumps
  - Backfilling versions for existing releases (currently out of scope)
  - Integration with upgrade command to compare user's template version with latest
  - Surfacing version increment count in release notes for debugging

  The implementation aligns with "Approach 1: Pre-Release Version Bump Commit" from
  the initial brainstorming, which was selected for its clean git history and
  guarantee that tags point to commits containing versioned templates.

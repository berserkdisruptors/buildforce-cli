summary: |
  Comprehensive README.md documentation serving as the primary entry point for developers
  discovering BuildForce CLI. Includes complete explanation of Spec-Driven Development
  philosophy, installation instructions, quick start guide, CLI command reference, detailed
  workflow documentation with visual Mermaid diagram, all 6 slash commands with examples,
  11 supported AI assistants, troubleshooting guide, contribution guidelines, roadmap,
  and complete project metadata (badges, changelog, license, links).

responsibilities:
  - Explain Spec-Driven Development (SDD) philosophy and value proposition
  - Provide installation instructions for npm, npx, and git clone on all platforms
  - Document quick start workflow from project initialization to first feature completion
  - Reference all CLI command options and flags (--ai, --script, --here, --force, etc.)
  - Document all 6 slash commands (/research, /spec, /plan, /build, /complete, /document) with syntax and examples
  - Visualize workflow with Mermaid diagram showing 5-command core + 1 utility command
  - List all 11 supported AI assistants with configuration folders
  - Provide troubleshooting guidance for 5 common setup issues
  - Define contribution guidelines (issues, PRs, code standards, commit format)
  - Link to external documentation site (https://buildforce.dev)
  - Present roadmap with planned features across v0.1.0, v0.2.0, v1.0.0
  - Reference CHANGELOG.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
  - Display project badges (npm version, downloads, stars, license, build status)

  internal:
    - package.json: "Source of version, license, repository URL, engine requirements"
    - src/config/agents.ts: "List of supported AI assistants with folder mappings"
    - src/cli.ts: "CLI command structure and options"
    - .buildforce/context/slash-commands.yml: "Slash command workflow documentation"
    - CHANGELOG.md: "Version history and release notes"
    - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md: "Community guidelines (referenced but currently empty)"
    - LICENSE: "MIT license file"

    - Contributor Covenant: "CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md standard (v2.1)"

files:
  primary:
    - README.md
    - CHANGELOG.md
    - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

design_decisions:
  - decision: "Place Spec-Driven Development philosophy at the top before hero section"
    rationale: "Establishes conceptual foundation first, helping readers understand 'why' before 'what' and 'how'. Differentiates BuildForce from generic CLI tools by leading with methodology."

  - decision: "Use Mermaid for workflow diagram instead of ASCII art"
    rationale: "Mermaid provides professional-looking diagrams, widely supported on GitHub, renders on npm, and easier to maintain than ASCII art."

  - decision: "Single README.md file instead of multiple documentation files"
    rationale: "Better discoverability (everything in one place), follows GitHub conventions, meets npm package page requirements. Detailed docs live at buildforce.dev."

  - decision: "Progressive disclosure strategy with links to buildforce.dev"
    rationale: "README focuses on getting started quickly (installation, quick start, examples), while buildforce.dev handles deep dives (API docs, advanced guides, tutorials)."

  - decision: "Create CHANGELOG.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md as separate files rather than inline in README"
    rationale: "Follows GitHub standard conventions, keeps README focused, allows independent maintenance. CHANGELOG uses Keep a Changelog format, CODE_OF_CONDUCT references Contributor Covenant v2.1."

  - decision: "All examples are copy-pasteable with no placeholders"
    rationale: "Reduces friction for new users. Examples should work without modification (NFR3 requirement)."

  - decision: "Document all 11 AI assistants in table format with configuration folders"
    rationale: "Clear mapping from assistant name to folder (.claude/, .github/, etc.) sourced from src/config/agents.ts ensures accuracy."

  - decision: "Include 5 troubleshooting issues instead of minimum 3"
    rationale: "Covers most common setup problems: Node version, permissions, git installation, network/GitHub rate limits, slash command recognition."

evolution:
  - version: "1.0"
    date: "2025-10-10"
    changes: "Comprehensive README with 1013 lines covering SDD philosophy, installation, quick start, CLI reference, workflow documentation, 6 slash commands, 11 AI assistants, troubleshooting, contribution guidelines, roadmap, changelog, license. Created CHANGELOG.md (Keep a Changelog format) and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (empty)."

notes: |
  This README update is critical for BuildForce CLI adoption and contribution rate.

  Implementation context:
  - README.md was already comprehensively implemented in a previous build iteration (1013 lines)
  - This /build focused on creating missing CHANGELOG.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
  - All 18 functional requirements (FR1-FR18) validated and met
  - All 6 non-functional requirements (NFR1-NFR6) validated and met
  - All 18 acceptance criteria (AC1-AC18) validated and met
  - README length: 1013 lines (within 800-1500 target)
  - No deviations from plan

  Key sections in README (in order):
  1. Badges (npm version, downloads, stars, license, build status)
  2. Table of Contents (18 sections)
  3. What is Spec-Driven Development? (philosophy and value proposition)
  4. What is BuildForce CLI? (product explanation)
  5. Why BuildForce? (benefits for individuals, teams, open source)
  6. Installation (3 methods: npm, npx, git clone)
  7. Quick Start (60-second workflow example)
  8. CLI Command Reference (all flags documented)
  9. Workflow Overview (Mermaid diagram + 5 core commands + 1 utility)
  10. Supported AI Assistants (11 assistants in table format)
  11. Troubleshooting (5 common issues with solutions)
  12. Roadmap (v0.1.0, v0.2.0, v1.0.0 planned features)
  13. Contributing (9-step process, commit format, standards)
  14. Changelog (link to CHANGELOG.md)
  15. License (MIT with full text)
  16. Links & Resources (official, community, related projects)

  The README successfully demonstrates BuildForce's value proposition through
  structure (following its own SDD methodology) and content (comprehensive
  documentation of the workflow it enables).

  CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md created empty per user request. Can be populated later
  with Contributor Covenant v2.1 content if needed.

  CHANGELOG.md follows Keep a Changelog format with:
  - [Unreleased] section for future changes
  - [0.0.1] documenting initial release features
  - Version history links to GitHub releases

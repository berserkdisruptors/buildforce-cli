summary: |
  Conversation-based research materialization system that enables agents to create structured
  research.yaml artifacts from conversation history during /plan execution, supporting consumption
  by /build and /complete commands for context-aware operation.

responsibilities:
  - Enable agents to materialize conversation history into structured research.yaml artifacts
  - Preserve diagrams, data models, and code snippets during materialization
  - Enable /plan, /build, /complete commands to consume research context
  - Maintain flexible YAML structure adapting to research content type

dependencies:
  internal:
    - research-slash-command: "Presents research findings in conversation"
    - spec-command: "Can materialize research.yaml from conversation history for context-aware spec population"
    - build-command: "Loads research.yaml for implementation context"
    - complete-command: "Reads research.yaml for context enrichment"
    - cli-architecture: "Template distribution via GitHub Release packaging"
  external: []

files:
  primary:
    - src/templates/research-template.yaml
    - src/templates/commands/research.md
    - src/templates/commands/plan.md
  secondary:
    - src/templates/commands/build.md
    - src/templates/commands/complete.md
    - .gitignore

design_decisions:
  - decision: "Conversation-based materialization (removed cache accumulation)"
    rationale: "Prioritizes user experience over theoretical edge cases. Cache accumulation required explicit file write permissions at each /research invocation, creating significant UX friction. Conversation history provides sufficient context for materialization during /plan."

  - decision: "Intelligent materialization preserving diagrams, models, snippets"
    rationale: "Balances condensation with information richness. Mermaid diagrams, data models, code snippets are essential for /build context - preserve verbatim. Condense prose, merge TLDR bullets."

  - decision: "research.yaml as permanent spec artifact"
    rationale: "research.yaml is versioned alongside spec.yaml and plan.yaml as permanent artifact. Provides valuable context for /build and /complete without temporary cache files."

  - decision: "Flexible template structure with optional sections"
    rationale: "Not all research produces diagrams/models/code. Template adapts to content type - omit empty sections. Prevents rigid enforcement that loses information."

  - decision: "Template-only implementation"
    rationale: "No code changes needed. All modifications are in command templates and documentation. Maintains consistency with Buildforce CLI's architecture."

architecture_patterns:
  research_workflow: |
    /research command workflow:
    1. Gather context from project knowledge (_index.yaml), codebase, and external sources
    2. Present structured report to user with diagrams, data models, file paths, TLDR
    3. Research findings remain in conversation history (no file persistence)

  materialization_workflow: |
    /plan command workflow (when research context exists):
    1. Agent materializes conversation history into research.yaml (optional, agent-driven)
    2. Read .buildforce/templates/research-template.yaml for structure guidance
    3. Intelligent materialization from conversation:
       - PRESERVE VERBATIM: Mermaid diagrams, data models, code snippets
       - PRESERVE WITH CONTEXT: File paths (with relevance), architectural decisions (with rationale)
       - CONDENSE: Research summary prose, project context
       - MERGE: TLDR bullets if multiple research sessions
    4. Write specs/{folder}/research.yaml with flexible structure
    5. Read research.yaml to inform spec.yaml population:
       - Extract requirements from key_findings
       - Populate open_questions with research ambiguities
       - Reference architectural_decisions in design principles

  consumption_workflow: |
    /plan command:
    - Can read existing research.yaml to maintain context consistency during updates

    /build command:
    - Loads research.yaml alongside spec.yaml and plan.yaml
    - Accesses: file_paths, mermaid_diagrams, data_models, code_snippets, architectural_decisions, TLDR

    /complete command:
    - Reads research.yaml to enrich context file documentation
    - Extracts: file_paths, architectural_decisions, key_findings

materialized_format: |
  Flexible YAML structure with optional sections:

  id: "{spec-id}-research"
  created: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  last_updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"

    Condensed 2-4 sentence overview

  key_findings:
    - "Discovery with context"

  file_paths:  # OPTIONAL
    primary:
      - path: "src/file.ts"
        relevance: "Why this matters"

  mermaid_diagrams:  # OPTIONAL - preserved verbatim

      diagram: |
        ```mermaid
        graph TD

      properties:
        - name: "prop"
          type: "string"

  code_snippets:  # OPTIONAL - preserved complete

evolution:
  - version: "1.0"
    date: "2025-10-28"
    changes: "Initial implementation of research persistence with three-stage pipeline (accumulation, materialization, cleanup). Added cache format with session metadata, flexible research.yaml template, and consumption logic in /plan, /build, /complete commands."

  - version: "2.0"
    date: "2025-11-03"
    changes: "Removed cache accumulation mechanism to prioritize user experience. Eliminated .research-cache.md file operations that required explicit permissions at each /research invocation. Simplified to conversation-based materialization where agents create research.yaml from conversation history during /plan. Removed cache cleanup from /complete. Template-only changes with no TypeScript modifications."

notes: |
  Key design principles:
  - "Research is cheap to generate but valuable when it informs a specific spec"
  - "Keep spec.yaml clean - research context belongs in separate artifact"
  - "Intelligent materialization - condense, don't copy-paste"
  - "Graceful degradation - spec can proceed without research context"
  - "Single source of truth - one research.yaml per spec"
  - "Prioritize UX over theoretical edge case coverage"

  Template-only implementation:
  - No TypeScript/JavaScript code changes
  - Modified 4 command templates + research-template.yaml
  - Updated README.md and .gitignore
  - Automatic distribution via existing release packaging script

  Architecture evolution (v2.0):
  - Removed: .research-cache.md accumulation, buildforce.json state checking, cache cleanup
  - Preserved: research.yaml materialization capability, consumption by /build and /complete
  - Trade-off: Lost interrupted session recovery, gained frictionless UX

  Future enhancements:
  - Validation for research.yaml structure (schema checking)
  - Explicit /research --materialize flag for immediate research.yaml creation
  - Document best practices for research-heavy workflows

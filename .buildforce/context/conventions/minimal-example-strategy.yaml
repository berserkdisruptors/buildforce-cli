  Context files and templates use 5-10 line code snippets instead of verbose
  examples. Full implementations are referenced via reference_files arrays.
  This prevents context window bloat while providing actionable guidance.
  AI agents can read reference files on-demand during /build if they need
  detailed examples.
  

reference_files:
  - ".buildforce/templates/guidelines-template.yaml"

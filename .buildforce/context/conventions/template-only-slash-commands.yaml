description: |
  All slash commands are implemented as markdown templates in src/templates/commands/,
  NOT as TypeScript code. The CLI infrastructure reads these templates and passes them
  to Claude AI agents for execution. This keeps the CLI thin and puts all logic in
  AI-interpretable instructions.
  

examples:
  - file: "src/templates/commands/plan.md"
    snippet: |
      # /plan command template
      User input: $ARGUMENTS
      **Your task**: Create structured plan...

description: |
  All bash scripts in .buildforce/scripts/bash/ must be called from the current
  working directory (project root), never from nested directories. Scripts use
  relative paths from project root. This ensures consistent behavior regardless
  of where buildforce is invoked.
  

reference_files:
  - ".buildforce/scripts/bash/get-spec-paths.sh"
  - ".buildforce/scripts/bash/create-session-files.sh"

template: |
  # Good - called from project root
  .buildforce/scripts/bash/get-spec-paths.sh --json
  
  # Bad - assumes nested directory context
  cd .buildforce/scripts && bash ./get-spec-paths.sh

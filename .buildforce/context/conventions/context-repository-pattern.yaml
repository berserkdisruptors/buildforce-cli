description: |
  Project knowledge lives in .buildforce/context/ as YAML files. Each context file
  captures a specific aspect of the project (glossary, API patterns, architecture).
  Context files are registered in _index.yaml with descriptive tags for discovery.
  This creates a "living documentation" system that evolves with the project.
  

examples:
  - file: ".buildforce/context/_glossary.yaml"
    snippet: |
      version: "0.0.33"
      terms:
        - term: "spec"
          definition: "Structured YAML file capturing WHAT needs to be built"
      

reference_files:
  - ".buildforce/context/_index.yaml"
  - ".buildforce/context/_glossary.yaml"

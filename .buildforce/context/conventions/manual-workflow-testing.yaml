  Since slash commands are templates interpreted by AI, automated unit tests
  have limited value. Primary testing strategy is end-to-end workflow testing:
  run actual commands and verify output files match expected structure.
  

examples:
  - file: "example"
    snippet: |
      # Test /plan workflow
      1. Run /plan for new feature
      2. Verify spec.yaml created with correct schema
      3. Check plan.yaml contains all required sections
      4. Validate YAML syntax with yamllint

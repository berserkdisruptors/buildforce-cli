description: |
  The CLI previously tracked current spec using .current-spec file. This has been
  migrated to buildforce.json for better structure and extensibility. Legacy code
  may still reference .current-spec in comments/docs, but all new code must use
  buildforce.json state tracking.

  - "buildforce.json (current state tracking)"

migration_guide: |
  When updating old templates or docs, replace references to .current-spec with
  buildforce.json. The migration is complete, but historical context helps explain
  why both terms appear in discussions.

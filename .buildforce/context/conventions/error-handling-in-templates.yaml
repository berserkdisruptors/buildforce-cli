description: |
  Slash command templates must include error handling instructions for AI agents.
  Use "NEVER proceed if script fails" pattern with actionable user guidance.
  This prevents silent failures when prerequisites are missing.
  

reference_files:
  - "src/templates/commands/build.md"
  - "src/templates/commands/complete.md"

template: |
  Run `.buildforce/scripts/bash/get-spec-paths.sh --json` FROM CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY.
  **NEVER proceed** if script fails - display error, explain .buildforce directory not found,
  suggest: 1) check if in buildforce root directory, 2) run `buildforce init .` if needed.

name: "Simplify Slash Command Documentation"
type: feature
status: draft
created: "2025-11-03"
last_updated: "2025-11-03"

summary: |
  Simplify the slash command documentation in README.md by removing technical implementation
  details, file structure examples, and key features sections while retaining user-focused
  high-level descriptions, practical examples, and optimization tips.

# INTENT / PROBLEM STATEMENT

problem: |
  Current slash command documentation in README.md (lines 127-470) is overly technical with
  8-10 numbered implementation steps showing internal mechanics (scripts, file paths, validation).
  YAML file structure examples and "Key features" sections add length without helping users
  understand the value proposition. Users need to quickly understand WHAT each command does
  from their perspective to decide if they trust the system, not HOW it works under the hood.

motivation: |
  Simplified documentation will reduce cognitive load and improve user experience. By focusing
  on user perspective rather than technical implementation, developers can quickly scan commands,
  understand their purpose, see practical examples, and get optimization tips without wading
  through implementation details. This makes the README more accessible and actionable.

# GOALS

primary_goals:
  - Simplify "What it does" sections from technical step-by-step to high-level user-perspective descriptions
  - Remove all YAML file structure examples from command documentation
  - Remove "Key features" sections while retaining essential information

secondary_goals:
  - Maintain consistency across all 5 command sections
  - Preserve the helpful pro tips that users appreciate
  - Keep 1-3 practical examples per command (reduce from 3+ where excessive)

# REQUIREMENTS

functional_requirements:
  - FR1: Transform "What it does" sections into 2-4 sentence high-level descriptions focusing on user outcomes, not technical implementation steps
  - FR2: Remove all YAML code block examples showing file structures (spec.yaml, plan.yaml, context.yaml examples)
  - FR3: Remove "Key features" bullet list sections from all command documentation
  - FR4: Preserve "Purpose", "Usage", and "Pro tip" sections unchanged
  - FR5: Retain 1-3 practical examples per command, reducing from 3+ where appropriate
  - FR6: Maintain consistent structure across all 5 commands (/research, /spec, /build, /complete, /document)

non_functional_requirements:
  - NFR1: Documentation should feel lightweight and scannable while remaining informative
  - NFR2: User-perspective language should build trust without exposing unnecessary complexity
  - NFR3: Changes should not alter the accuracy of documentation (no functional misrepresentation)

# SCOPE

in_scope:
  - README.md lines 127-470 (all 5 slash command sections)
  - Simplifying /research command documentation (lines 129-174)
  - Simplifying /spec command documentation (lines 176-248)
  - Simplifying /build command documentation (lines 250-320)
  - Simplifying /complete command documentation (lines 322-392)
  - Simplifying /document command documentation (lines 394-469)

out_of_scope:
  - Command template files in src/templates/commands/ (these remain unchanged)
  - Context files in .buildforce/context/ (no changes needed)
  - Other README sections (Quick Start, How It Works, Installation, etc.)
  - Actual command functionality or behavior

# DESIGN PRINCIPLES

design_principles:
  - "User perspective over implementation details: Focus on outcomes, not mechanics"
  - "Simplicity without sacrificing clarity: Remove noise while preserving understanding"
  - "Consistency across sections: All commands follow identical simplified structure"
  - "Trust through accessibility: Users should quickly grasp value without technical overhead"

# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

acceptance_criteria:
  - AC1: All 5 "What it does" sections are 2-4 sentences describing user outcomes instead of 8-10 technical steps
  - AC2: Zero YAML code block examples remain in slash command sections (lines 127-470)
  - AC3: All "Key features" sections are removed from command documentation
  - AC4: All "Purpose", "Usage", "Examples", and "Pro tip" sections remain intact
  - AC5: Each command has 1-3 examples (none have more than 3)
  - AC6: Documentation structure is consistent across all 5 commands
  - AC7: Total documentation length reduced by approximately 30-40% while maintaining clarity

# ASSUMPTIONS & DEPENDENCIES

assumptions:
  - Users prefer high-level understanding over technical transparency in documentation
  - Pro tips provide sufficient optimization guidance without key features sections
  - 1-3 examples are adequate to demonstrate command usage patterns

dependencies:
  internal:
    - README.md: "Primary documentation file to be modified"
  external:
    - None

# OPEN QUESTIONS

# NOTES

notes: |
  Research revealed current documentation is accurate but overly detailed. This change optimizes
  for user experience and trust-building rather than complete transparency. Implementation
  details remain available in command template files and context files for those who need them.
  
  The simplified format will make README more approachable for new users while maintaining
  accuracy and consistency.

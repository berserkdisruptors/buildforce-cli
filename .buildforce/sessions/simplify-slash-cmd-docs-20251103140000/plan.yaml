# ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

approach: |
  Edit README.md to transform each of the 5 slash command sections by: (1) replacing technical
  "What it does" steps with 2-4 sentence user-perspective descriptions, (2) removing all YAML
  file structure examples, (3) removing "Key features" sections, and (4) trimming examples to
  1-3 where appropriate. Each command section will be updated sequentially to maintain consistency
  and reduce errors. The simplified structure will be: Purpose → Usage → Examples → What it does
  (high-level) → Pro tip.

technology_stack:
  - Markdown editing (README.md)
  - Text content transformation (technical → user-perspective)

decisions:
  - decision: "Process commands sequentially rather than all at once"
    rationale: "Sequential updates allow verification of consistent structure after each command section. Reduces risk of formatting inconsistencies across sections."

  - decision: "Craft user-perspective descriptions emphasizing outcomes and trust-building"
    rationale: "User's stated goal is to help readers decide if they trust the system. Focus on what users gain rather than implementation mechanics."

  - decision: "Remove YAML examples completely rather than simplify them"
    rationale: "User explicitly requested removal of generated file structures. Users who need these details can reference command templates or context files."

# TESTING GUIDANCE

testing:
  manual_tests:
    - scenario: "Documentation comprehension test"
      steps: |
        1. Read through each simplified command section
        2. Verify user can understand WHAT the command does without technical details
        3. Confirm pro tips remain actionable
        4. Ensure examples demonstrate practical usage
        5. Check that documentation builds trust without overwhelming detail

    - scenario: "Structure consistency verification"
      steps: |
        1. Compare structure of all 5 command sections
        2. Verify identical ordering: Purpose → Usage → Examples → What it does → Pro tip
        3. Ensure formatting consistency (headers, code blocks, spacing)

# VALIDATION CRITERIA

  - "All command sections simplified to consistent 5-part structure"
  - "Documentation length reduced by 30-40% while maintaining clarity"
  - "User perspective language improves readability and trust-building"

# PROGRESS SUMMARY

overall_progress:
  phase_1: "4/4 tasks completed"
  phase_2: "5/5 tasks completed"
  phase_3: "6/6 tasks completed"
  phase_4: "5/5 tasks completed"
  phase_5: "5/5 tasks completed"
  phase_6: "4/4 tasks completed"

current_status: |
  All phases completed successfully. Simplified all 5 slash command documentation sections
  in README.md. Achieved 62% reduction (213 lines removed) while maintaining accuracy and
  improving readability. All commands now follow consistent user-perspective structure.

next_immediate_steps:
  - "Run manual testing to verify documentation comprehension"
  - "Validate accuracy and trust-building language"
  - "Ready for final review and validation"

# RISKS & CONSIDERATIONS

risks:
  - risk: "User-perspective descriptions may be too vague or lose important nuance"
    mitigation: "Focus on outcomes and value while maintaining accuracy. Review each description for clarity and trust-building language."

  - risk: "Removing examples might make some commands less clear"
    mitigation: "Keep most practical examples (1-3 per command). Only reduce where excessive."

  - risk: "Inconsistency in simplified structure across commands"
    mitigation: "Use phase 6 for comprehensive consistency verification. Apply identical structure pattern to all sections."

# NOTES

lessons_learned: []

future_enhancements:
  - "Consider adding a separate 'Technical Details' appendix for users who want implementation specifics"
  - "Evaluate if command template files should have similar user-perspective documentation"

name: "Rename .buildforce/specs to .buildforce/sessions"
type: feature
status: completed
created: "2025-11-21"
last_updated: "2025-11-21"

summary: |
  Rename the `.buildforce/specs` folder to `.buildforce/sessions` throughout the codebase to better reflect its purpose as session-based development tracking, and rename the unused `specsFolder` config field to `sessionsFolder`.

# INTENT / PROBLEM STATEMENT

problem: |
  The current folder name `.buildforce/specs` suggests it only stores specification files, but it actually stores complete development sessions (spec.yaml, plan.yaml, research.yaml).
  The term "sessions" better captures the ephemeral, workflow-oriented nature of these folders.
  Additionally, the `specsFolder` field in BuildforceConfig is defined but never used, creating confusion.

motivation: |
  Renaming to "sessions" provides clearer semantics that align with the spec-driven development workflow philosophy.
  Each folder represents a full development session with research, planning, and implementation tracking.
  This change improves code clarity and sets the foundation for future session-based features.
  Since there are no active users yet, this is the ideal time to make this breaking change.

# GOALS

primary_goals:
  - Replace all references to `.buildforce/specs` with `.buildforce/sessions` across the codebase
  - Rename `specsFolder` to `sessionsFolder` in BuildforceConfig interface and related code
  - Ensure all scripts (bash and PowerShell) use the new folder name
  - Update all command templates to reference the new folder path
  - Update user-facing documentation and output messages

secondary_goals:
  - Maintain consistency across all platforms (Unix/Linux/macOS via bash, Windows via PowerShell)
  - Ensure no broken references remain after the rename

# REQUIREMENTS

functional_requirements:
  - FR1: All hardcoded `.buildforce/specs` string literals must be replaced with `.buildforce/sessions` in TypeScript source files
  - FR2: All hardcoded `.buildforce/specs` paths in bash scripts must be updated to `.buildforce/sessions`
  - FR3: All hardcoded `.buildforce/specs` paths in PowerShell scripts must be updated to `.buildforce/sessions`
  - FR4: All references to `.buildforce/specs` in command templates (plan.md, complete.md) must be updated to `.buildforce/sessions`
  - FR5: The `specsFolder` field in BuildforceConfig interface must be renamed to `sessionsFolder`
  - FR6: All usages of `specsFolder` variable names must be renamed to `sessionsFolder` for consistency
  - FR7: User-facing output messages displaying the folder path must show `.buildforce/sessions/`
  - FR8: Documentation (README.md) must be updated to reflect the new folder name

non_functional_requirements:
  - NFR1: All changes must be applied atomically to prevent inconsistent state
  - NFR2: The rename must not break existing functionality or workflows
  - NFR3: Variable and field names should follow existing naming conventions (camelCase for TS, snake_case for bash)
  - NFR4: Comments and documentation must be updated alongside code changes

# SCOPE

in_scope:
  - Renaming all `.buildforce/specs` references to `.buildforce/sessions` in 11 identified files
  - Renaming `specsFolder` to `sessionsFolder` in TypeScript interfaces and configuration utilities
  - Updating bash scripts: create-spec-files.sh, common.sh
  - Updating PowerShell scripts: create-spec-files.ps1, common.ps1
  - Updating command templates: plan.md, complete.md
  - Updating TypeScript source: config.ts, types.ts, init/output.ts
  - Updating documentation: README.md
  - Renaming related variables (e.g., SPECS_DIR → SESSIONS_DIR, specsDir → sessionsDir)

out_of_scope:
  - Migration logic for existing user projects (no active users exist)
  - Backward compatibility layer for old folder names
  - Renaming the actual .buildforce/specs folder in this repo (will happen naturally on next workflow run)
  - Changes to files in .buildforce/context/ (these reference the pattern, not the literal path)

# DESIGN PRINCIPLES

design_principles:
  - "Search and replace with precision - use exact string matching to avoid false positives"
  - "Maintain symmetry between bash and PowerShell implementations"
  - "Update all related variable names for consistency (not just path literals)"
  - "Preserve code structure and formatting during replacements"

# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

acceptance_criteria:
  - AC1: No occurrences of `specsFolder` remain in TypeScript source files (should be `sessionsFolder`)
  - AC2: No occurrences of `.buildforce/specs` remain in bash scripts (should be `.buildforce/sessions`)
  - AC3: No occurrences of `.buildforce/specs` remain in PowerShell scripts (should be `.buildforce/sessions`)
  - AC4: Command templates reference `.buildforce/sessions` in all path instructions
  - AC5: User-facing messages display `.buildforce/sessions/` instead of `.buildforce/specs/`
  - AC6: README.md mentions sessions folder instead of specs folder
  - AC7: Variable names follow conventions: sessionsDir (TS/PS), SESSIONS_DIR (bash)
  - AC8: All changes compile without errors and existing workflows continue to function

# ASSUMPTIONS & DEPENDENCIES

assumptions:
  - No active users exist who would have .buildforce/specs folders in their projects
  - Migration logic is not required
  - The literal folder in this repository (.buildforce/specs/) does not need to be renamed as part of this change
  - All identified files in research are the complete set of references

dependencies:
  internal:
    - bash scripts: "create-spec-files.sh and common.sh must be updated together for path consistency"
    - PowerShell scripts: "create-spec-files.ps1 and common.ps1 must be updated together"
    - templates: "plan.md and complete.md reference the folder in AI agent instructions"
    - config utilities: "types.ts defines interface, config.ts provides default value"

# NOTES

notes: |
  This is a breaking change but safe to implement now since there are no active users.
  The research identified 11 files with ~25+ total occurrences.
  The change improves semantic clarity and aligns with the session-based development workflow philosophy.
  Future work could wire up the sessionsFolder config field to actually be used instead of hardcoded paths.

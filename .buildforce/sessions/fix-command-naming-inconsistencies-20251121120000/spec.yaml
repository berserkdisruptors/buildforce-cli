name: "Fix Slash Command Naming Inconsistencies"
type: feature
status: draft
created: "2025-11-21"
last_updated: "2025-11-21"

summary: |
  Update all slash command references in user-facing files, templates, and documentation outside
  the .buildforce/ folder to use the standardized /buildforce.* prefix format. This ensures
  consistent command naming across the codebase and prevents user confusion.

# INTENT / PROBLEM STATEMENT

problem: |
  The codebase contains inconsistent slash command references with a mix of old unprefixed format
  (/plan, /build, /complete, /document, /research) and new prefixed format (/buildforce.plan,
  /buildforce.build, etc.). Research identified 11 files outside .buildforce/ with old references,
  causing confusion for users who see incorrect command syntax in documentation and CLI output.
  This inconsistency resulted from incomplete transitions during previous command renames.

motivation: |
  Standardizing all command references to the /buildforce.* prefix format will eliminate user
  confusion, ensure documentation accuracy, and maintain the namespace isolation pattern that
  prevents command name collisions. The buildforce. prefix is documented as the official standard
  in cli-architecture.yaml and should be consistently applied across all user-facing content.

# GOALS

primary_goals:
  - Update all old unprefixed command references to /buildforce.* format in files outside .buildforce/
  - Ensure README.md and src/commands/examples.ts show correct command syntax to users
  - Maintain consistency across all template files and command documentation

secondary_goals:
  - Document the standard command naming convention for future reference
  - Prevent similar inconsistencies in future command updates
  - Preserve historical spec folders as archive artifacts

# REQUIREMENTS

functional_requirements:
  - FR1: Update src/commands/examples.ts lines 24 and 33 to use /buildforce.* command format in workflow arrays
  - FR2: Update README.md to replace all old command references (/plan, /build, /complete, /document, /research) with /buildforce.* equivalents
  - FR3: Update src/templates/commands/build.md line 13 context description to use /buildforce.build
  - FR4: Update src/templates/commands/complete.md line 10 context description to use /buildforce.complete
  - FR5: Update src/templates/commands/document.md line 91 to use /buildforce.build and /buildforce.plan consistently
  - FR6: Update src/templates/commands/research.md line 10 context description to use /buildforce.research
  - FR7: Update src/templates/plan-template.yaml comments (lines 2, 3, 89, 102, 166, 186) to use /buildforce.build
  - FR8: Update src/templates/guidelines-template.yaml comments to use /buildforce.* format throughout
  - FR9: Update src/templates/research-template.yaml comments (lines 14, 29) to use /buildforce.build and /buildforce.plan
  - FR10: Exclude all files within .buildforce/ folder from updates per user request
  - FR11: Verify all five core commands are consistently referenced: /buildforce.research, /buildforce.plan, /buildforce.build, /buildforce.complete, /buildforce.document

non_functional_requirements:
  - NFR1: Changes must not affect command functionality or behavior
  - NFR2: Updates must maintain original file structure and formatting
  - NFR3: Historical spec folders in .buildforce/specs/ must remain unchanged as archive artifacts
  - NFR4: All changes must be backward compatible (no breaking changes to command invocation)

# SCOPE

in_scope:
  - Updating command references in src/commands/examples.ts
  - Updating command references in README.md
  - Updating command references in all src/templates/ files (commands/*.md, *.yaml)
  - Ensuring consistency across all five core commands (/buildforce.research, /buildforce.plan, /buildforce.build, /buildforce.complete, /buildforce.document)

out_of_scope:
  - Files within .buildforce/ folder (excluded per user request)
  - Historical spec folders in .buildforce/specs/ (archive artifacts)
  - Renaming command template files (already follow buildforce.*.md pattern)
  - Changing command invocation behavior or functionality
  - Updating context documentation files in .buildforce/context/

# DESIGN PRINCIPLES

design_principles:
  - "Namespace isolation: All commands use /buildforce.* prefix to prevent name collisions"
  - "Consistency: All user-facing references use identical command format"
  - "Historical preservation: Archive artifacts remain unchanged for accuracy"
  - "Documentation-first: Ensure users see correct command syntax in all interactions"

# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

acceptance_criteria:
  - AC1: src/commands/examples.ts workflow arrays use /buildforce.plan, /buildforce.build, /buildforce.complete, /buildforce.research, /buildforce.document
  - AC2: README.md contains zero old unprefixed command references; all examples use /buildforce.* format
  - AC3: All src/templates/commands/*.md files reference commands with /buildforce.* prefix in context descriptions
  - AC4: All src/templates/*.yaml files use /buildforce.* format in comments and documentation
  - AC5: No files outside .buildforce/ contain old unprefixed command references (/plan, /build, etc.)
  - AC6: Files within .buildforce/ folder remain unmodified
  - AC7: Historical spec folders in .buildforce/specs/ remain unchanged
  - AC8: All five core commands referenced consistently: /buildforce.research, /buildforce.plan, /buildforce.build, /buildforce.complete, /buildforce.document

# ASSUMPTIONS & DEPENDENCIES

assumptions:
  - The /buildforce.* prefix is the established standard per cli-architecture.yaml:269
  - Command template files already follow buildforce.*.md naming pattern
  - Historical spec folders should preserve original command references for archive accuracy
  - User request to exclude .buildforce/ folder includes all subdirectories and files

dependencies:
  internal:
    - cli-architecture: "Defines buildforce.* namespace pattern and invocation conventions"
    - slash-commands: "Core command definitions and workflow documentation"
  external:
    - None

# RESOLVED QUESTIONS

resolved_questions:
  - question: "Should files in .buildforce/ folder be updated?"
    answer: "No - user explicitly requested to exclude .buildforce/ folder from updates"

  - question: "Should historical spec folders be updated?"
    answer: "No - historical specs are archive artifacts and should remain unchanged"

  - question: "Should we update only user-facing files or all files outside .buildforce/?"
    answer: "Update all files outside .buildforce/ including templates and documentation for complete consistency"

# NOTES

notes: |
  This fix addresses technical debt from incomplete command rename transitions. The research phase
  identified the scope and severity of inconsistencies. Priority is on user-facing files (README.md,
  examples.ts) which directly impact user experience, followed by templates which guide AI agent
  behavior. The buildforce.* namespace pattern is documented in cli-architecture.yaml and provides
  protection against command name collisions across 11 different AI assistant platforms.

  Historical spec folders contain references to old command names because they document work as it
  was performed. Updating these would compromise archive integrity and historical accuracy.

# ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

approach: |
  Create README v3 by combining the organizational structure from README-v2.md with restored technical depth from original README.md, while eliminating all marketing language identified in the analysis. The approach follows observable patterns from successful OSS CLI tools: technical depth first, minimal prose, inline documentation, action-oriented.

  Structure: 13 sections as specified by user, each with specific content constraints to prevent marketing creep. Source material strategically extracted from v2 where appropriate (sections 10-13) and original where needed (command docs).

  Content strategy:
  - Sections 1-2: Minimal (title + one-liner)
  - Sections 3-5: Concise technical explanation (problem/solution, context value, comparison)
  - Section 6-7: Action-oriented (install, examples)
  - Section 8: Maximum technical depth (200-250 lines command docs)
  - Sections 9-13: Reuse v2 content with minor adjustments

technology_stack:
  - Markdown (GitHub-flavored) for formatting
  - Mermaid (optional) for workflow diagrams if needed
  - Code blocks for command examples and terminal output
  - Tables for comparisons and AI assistant lists

decisions:
  - decision: "Restore command documentation to 200-250 lines total (30-40 per command)"
    rationale: "Analysis of successful CLI tools shows inline documentation is critical for developer conversion. fd has 100+, fzf has 150+, bat has 80+ lines of examples. Reducing to 15 lines (v2) killed discoverability. Developers need to answer 'can it do X?' without leaving README."

  - decision: "Eliminate 'The Problem' section, FAQ, and Enterprise/Security sections"
    rationale: "None of the successful OSS CLI tools (bat, ripgrep, fd, fzf) have these sections. They signal defensive positioning and reduce trust with individual developers. Problem/solution can be blended into 'What is Buildforce?' in 3-5 sentences."

  - decision: "Rename 'Try It in 2 Minutes' to 'Quick Start' and position at line 80-120"
    rationale: "'Quick Start' is standard terminology in OSS projects. Position early to reduce friction between interest and action, but after value proposition so developers understand why they're installing."

  - decision: "Create 'Why context-first?' as dedicated section"
    rationale: "This is Buildforce's key technical differentiation. Elevating it to a section (rather than burying in prose) highlights the value prop without marketing language. Keep it technical: explain what context persistence does, not how it 'transforms' development."

  - decision: "Section 7 'How It Works' must deliver the 'aha' moment before command documentation"
    rationale: "Buildforce is fundamentally different from typical CLI tools (bat, fd, ripgrep) - it uses slash commands INSIDE AI conversations to orchestrate workflow, not direct terminal commands. Developers won't understand usage from command syntax alone. Section 7 must show: (a) visual workflow representation, (b) step-by-step explanation of what happens at each command, (c) 3 concrete scenarios. This pedagogical approach mirrors testing frameworks (Jest shows complete test before explaining describe(), test(), expect()). Without this 'aha' moment, developers will read command docs without context and bounce."

  - decision: "Keep total length 600-800 lines with 70% technical content"
    rationale: "fd README is ~400 lines, fzf is ~200 but links to extensive docs, ripgrep is ~300. 600-800 allows comprehensive inline docs while staying focused. 70% technical ensures trust through depth rather than prose."

  - decision: "Reuse Contributing, Support & Community, License, Star CTA sections from v2 verbatim"
    rationale: "These sections were well-executed in v2 and don't contribute to the 'too salesy' problem. Reusing them saves effort and maintains consistency."

# IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

phase_1:
  name: "Foundation & Header Sections"
  description: |
    Create the foundational sections that establish identity and value proposition without marketing language.
    Sections 1-5: Title through Comparison table.

  tasks:
    - [x] Write Section 1: Title and badges (reuse from v2, verify npm package name)
      spec_refs: [FR1]
      files: [README.md]
      notes: "Keep badges minimal: npm version, downloads, stars, license"

    - [x] Write Section 2: One-liner tagline ("Context-first Spec-Driven Development framework")
      spec_refs: [FR1]
      files: [README.md]
      notes: "Single line, no bold, clear and technical"

    - [x] Write Section 3: What is Buildforce? (3-5 sentences blending problem and solution)
      spec_refs: [FR1, FR3, NFR2]
      files: [README.md]
      notes: "Technical, concise, no marketing language. Answer: what it does, what problem it solves."

    - [x] Write Section 4: Why context-first? (4-6 sentences explaining technical value)
      spec_refs: [FR1, FR4, NFR2]
      files: [README.md]
      notes: "Explain persistence mechanism, why it matters technically, benefit to workflow"

    - [x] Write Section 5: Comparison table (Traditional AI Assistant vs AI Assistant + Buildforce)
      spec_refs: [FR1, FR5]
      files: [README.md]
      notes: "5-7 rows, concrete technical differences. Example: 'Context lost after session' vs 'Context persists in .buildforce/context/'"

  validation:
    - [x] All phase_1 tasks completed
    - [x] Section 3 is 3-5 sentences maximum
    - [x] Section 4 is 4-6 sentences maximum
    - [x] No marketing language present (no "dramatically", "revolutionizing", etc.)
    - [x] Comparison table has concrete technical examples
    - [x] Spec requirements covered: [FR1, FR3, FR4, FR5, NFR2]

phase_2:
  name: "Installation & Workflow Examples"
  description: |
    Create action-oriented sections showing developers how to install and use the tool.
    CRITICAL: Section 7 "How It Works" is the pedagogical moment that delivers the "aha" understanding.
    Buildforce is NOT a typical CLI tool - commands are slash commands used INSIDE AI conversations to orchestrate workflow.
    Section 7 must show this orchestration pattern BEFORE diving into individual command documentation.
    Sections 6-7: Quick Start and How it works.

  tasks:
    - [x] Write Section 6: Quick Start with global install and npx examples
      spec_refs: [FR1, FR6, NFR5]
      files: [README.md]
      notes: "Show both: 'npm install -g @buildforce/cli' AND 'npx @buildforce/cli my-project'. Include basic usage after install."

    - [x] Write Section 7: How It Works - Add visual workflow representation
      spec_refs: [FR1, FR7, AC8]
      files: [README.md]
      notes: "Start with visual: /research → /spec → /plan → /build → /complete. Use arrows or simple diagram. This shows the orchestration pattern at a glance."

    - [x] Write Section 7: How It Works - Add step-by-step explanation
      spec_refs: [FR1, FR7, AC8]
      files: [README.md]
      notes: "Brief explanation of what happens at each command in the workflow. E.g., '/research gathers context from .buildforce/context/ and codebase', '/spec materializes intent into requirements'. This bridges visual to concrete examples."

    - [x] Write Section 7: How It Works - Basic example (/spec + /build)
      spec_refs: [FR1, FR7, AC8]
      files: [README.md]
      notes: "Minimal viable workflow showing entry point for simple features. Demonstrate you can skip research and jump to spec+build."

    - [x] Write Section 7: How It Works - Full example (/research + /spec + /build + /complete)
      spec_refs: [FR1, FR7, AC8]
      files: [README.md]
      notes: "Complete workflow showing all core commands in sequence. This is the canonical pattern."

    - [x] Write Section 7: How It Works - Manual context example (/research + /document)
      spec_refs: [FR1, FR7, AC8]
      files: [README.md]

    - scenario: "Content verification against spec requirements"
      steps: |
        1. Open README.md in editor
        2. Verify all 13 sections present in order (AC1)
        3. Count command documentation lines: should be 200-250 total (AC2)
        4. Search for marketing language terms: "dramatically", "revolutionizing", "game-changing", "The Problem", FAQ (AC3)
        5. Count sentences in "What is Buildforce?" section: should be 3-5 (AC4)
        6. Count sentences in "Why context-first?" section: should be 4-6 (AC5)
        7. Verify comparison table has 5-7 rows with technical differences (AC6)
        8. Check Quick Start section line number: should be <150 (AC7)
        9. Count workflow examples in "How It Works": should be exactly 3 (AC8)
        10. Verify Contributing, Support, License sections match v2 (AC9)
        11. Count total lines: should be 600-800 with ≥70% technical content (AC10)

    - scenario: "Developer conversion path simulation"
      steps: |
        1. Read README from top as if discovering project for first time
        2. Verify value proposition is clear within first 50 lines
        3. Check if installation path is obvious before line 150
        4. Attempt to answer "can Buildforce do X?" using only command docs (don't click away)
        5. Verify technical depth builds trust (accurate, detailed, no hype)

    - scenario: "Comparison with successful OSS CLI tools"
      steps: |
        1. Compare structure to bat, fd, fzf READMEs
        2. Verify similar patterns: minimal intro, early install, extensive inline docs
        3. Check tone matches: technical depth over marketing

overall_progress:
  phase_1: "0/5 tasks completed"
  phase_2: "0/4 tasks completed"
  phase_3: "0/6 tasks completed"
  phase_4: "0/6 tasks completed"

current_status: |
  Spec and plan created. Ready to begin implementation with /build command.

next_immediate_steps:
  - Run /build to begin phase 1 implementation
  - Write foundation sections 1-5 (Title through Comparison table)
  - Verify no marketing language in initial content

# RISKS & CONSIDERATIONS

risks:
  - risk: "Command documentation may drift from actual implementation if slash command templates change"
    mitigation: "Reference source templates in src/templates/commands/ during Phase 3 to ensure accuracy. Verify each command's features against template content."

  - risk: "Restoring 200-250 lines of command docs may make README feel too long"
    mitigation: "This is intentional - successful CLI tools have 100-200+ lines of examples inline. Developers expect comprehensive reference material. If future feedback indicates length is an issue, can split into COMMANDS.md at that time."

  - risk: "Reusing v2 sections (Contributing, Support, License) may introduce inconsistency if those sections had issues"
    mitigation: "User explicitly approved reuse of these sections. If issues are discovered during /build, will flag for user review."

  - risk: "Line count target (600-800) may be difficult to hit while keeping 70% technical content"
    mitigation: "Command docs alone contribute 200-250 lines. Quick Start, workflow examples, AI table, and other technical elements should easily reach 70% threshold. Monitor ratio during Phase 4 final review."

  - risk: "Comparison table may become marketing-focused if not carefully worded"
    mitigation: "Use concrete technical examples ('Context persists in .buildforce/context/' vs abstract claims. Each row should describe observable functionality difference."

# NOTES

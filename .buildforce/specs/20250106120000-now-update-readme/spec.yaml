name: "Comprehensive README Documentation for Buildforce CLI"
type: feature
status: draft
created: "2025-10-10"
last_updated: "2025-10-10"

summary: |
  Update README.md with comprehensive documentation explaining what Buildforce CLI does,
  how to use it, usage examples for developers, and contribution guidelines. The README
  should serve as the primary entry point for developers discovering the project.

# INTENT / PROBLEM STATEMENT

problem: |
  The current README.md contains only the project title "buildforce-cli" with no
  explanatory content. This creates several issues:
  - New developers cannot understand what the project does
  - No installation or usage instructions are available
  - No examples demonstrate the spec-driven development workflow
  - No contribution guidelines exist to encourage community participation
  - The project appears incomplete or abandoned to external visitors

motivation: |
  A comprehensive README is critical for:
  - Onboarding new developers and contributors quickly
  - Demonstrating the value proposition of spec-driven development
  - Providing clear installation and usage instructions
  - Showcasing the 5-command workflow with concrete examples
  - Building community confidence and encouraging contributions
  - Improving SEO and discoverability on GitHub and npm
  - Serving as marketing material for the project

# NOTES

notes: |
  This README update is critical for the project's adoption and contribution rate.

  User decisions incorporated:
  1. ✅ Include badges (npm version, downloads, stars, license, build status)
  2. ✅ Link to https://buildforce.dev for detailed documentation
  3. ✅ Include changelog section or link to CHANGELOG.md
  4. ❌ No user testimonials yet (future enhancement)
  5. ❌ No separate "Features" section (features explained through workflow)
  6. ✅ Reference Code of Conduct (to be created separately)
  7. ✅ Include roadmap/future plans section
  8. ✅ Add conceptual definition and philosophy at the top

  Key sections to prioritize:
  1. Conceptual definition and philosophy of Spec-Driven Development
  2. Hero section with badges and value proposition
  3. Quick start (minimal steps to first success)
  4. Workflow explanation with diagram
  5. Command reference with examples
  6. Roadmap and future plans
  7. Contribution guidelines with Code of Conduct reference
  8. Changelog link

  Recommended README structure:
  - Above the fold: Philosophy/Concept, What, Why, Badges, Quick Start
  - Middle section: How (workflow diagram, commands, examples)
  - Bottom section: Roadmap, Contributing, Changelog, License, Links

  Reference excellent CLI README examples:
  - https://github.com/vercel/next.js (comprehensive)
  - https://github.com/npm/cli (detailed commands)
  - https://github.com/git/git (contribution focus)

  The README should reflect the project's maturity (v0.0.1 but production-ready workflow).
  Balance between "early stage, needs contributors" and "stable, usable tool".

  Documentation site at https://buildforce.dev exists for detailed guides, so README
  should focus on getting started quickly and linking out for deep dives.

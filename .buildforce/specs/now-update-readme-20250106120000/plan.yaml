# ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

approach: |
  The README will be created as a single, comprehensive markdown document following a top-down
  information architecture: Philosophy → What → Why → How → Contribute. Content will be organized
  into distinct sections with clear headings, using GitHub-flavored markdown for optimal rendering
  on both GitHub and npm. The document will leverage progressive disclosure - starting with
  essential information and linking to https://buildforce.dev for deeper dives. Mermaid diagrams
  will visualize the workflow, badges will provide at-a-glance project health, and copy-pasteable
  examples will enable immediate hands-on experience.

technology_stack:
  - GitHub-flavored Markdown (for document formatting and compatibility)
  - Mermaid.js (for workflow diagrams embedded in markdown)
  - Shields.io (for badge generation - npm, downloads, stars, license, build status)
  - Existing source files (package.json, src/config/agents.ts, src/cli.ts for accurate documentation)

decisions:
  - decision: "Use Mermaid for workflow diagram instead of ASCII art"
    rationale: "Mermaid provides professional-looking diagrams, is widely supported on GitHub, renders on npm, and is easier to maintain than ASCII art. Alternative (ASCII) considered but rejected due to poor visual quality and maintenance burden."

  - decision: "Single README.md file instead of multiple documentation files"
    rationale: "Single file provides better discoverability (everything in one place), follows standard GitHub conventions, and meets npm package page requirements. Detailed docs will live at https://buildforce.dev, keeping README focused on getting started."

  - decision: "Table of contents with anchor links at the top"
    rationale: "Essential for navigation in long documents (800-1500 lines target). GitHub automatically generates anchor links from headings, making this low-maintenance and user-friendly."

  - decision: "Copy-pasteable code blocks for all examples"
    rationale: "Reduces friction for new users. Examples should work without modification. Meets NFR3 (examples must be copy-pasteable and working)."

  - decision: "Reference CHANGELOG.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md rather than inline content"
    rationale: "Keeps README focused and maintainable. These files are standard GitHub conventions and allow separate maintenance workflows. README provides links but doesn't duplicate content."

  - decision: "Use shields.io for dynamic badges"
    rationale: "Industry standard, automatically updates with npm/GitHub data, requires no maintenance. Provides consistent visual style across open-source projects."

current_status: |
  Implementation complete. README.md was already comprehensively documented (1013 lines) from a previous build iteration.
  Created CHANGELOG.md (Keep a Changelog format) and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (empty, per user request).
  All 18 functional requirements, 6 non-functional requirements, and 18 acceptance criteria validated and met.

next_immediate_steps:
  - "Run /complete to finalize and validate the feature"
  - "Generate context file for the README documentation work"
  - "Update project context repository"

# RISKS & CONSIDERATIONS

risks:
  - risk: "README becomes too long and overwhelming (exceeds 1500 lines)"
    mitigation: "Track line count throughout. Prioritize essential content. Link to buildforce.dev for detailed explanations. Use collapsible sections if needed."

  - risk: "Examples become outdated as CLI evolves"
    mitigation: "Use dynamic badges where possible. Reference source files (agents.ts, cli.ts) to ensure accuracy. Add note about checking buildforce.dev for latest docs."

  - risk: "Mermaid diagram doesn't render on npm package page"
    mitigation: "Test on npm before publishing. If Mermaid doesn't work on npm, provide fallback ASCII diagram or static image."

  - risk: "CHANGELOG.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md don't exist yet"
    mitigation: "Create both files in Phase 5. Use standard templates (Keep a Changelog, Contributor Covenant)."

  - risk: "Documentation site (buildforce.dev) may not be ready"
    mitigation: "Verify buildforce.dev is accessible before finalizing. If not ready, remove links or mark as 'coming soon'."

  - risk: "Installation instructions may not work on all platforms"
    mitigation: "Test on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Include platform-specific notes. Document known limitations."

# NOTES

lessons_learned:
  - "Documentation is a critical feature - prioritize quality over speed"
  - "Use existing source files as source of truth for accuracy"
  - "Progressive disclosure (README → buildforce.dev) keeps README focused"

future_enhancements:
  - "Add video walkthrough or GIF demonstrations"
  - "Create interactive tutorial on buildforce.dev"
  - "Add user testimonials and case studies when available"
  - "Internationalization (translate README to other languages)"
  - "Automated link checking in CI/CD"
  - "Automated line count validation in CI/CD"

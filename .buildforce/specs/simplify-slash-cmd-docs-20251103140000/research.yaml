summary: |
  Comprehensive analysis of slash command documentation in README.md covering all 5 commands
  (/research, /spec, /build, /complete, /document). Research revealed consistent documentation
  structure across commands with technical implementation details, YAML examples, and key features
  sections. Documentation accurately reflects actual command template behavior.

key_findings:
  - "README documents 5 slash commands with consistent 7-component structure: purpose, usage, examples, workflow steps, key features, YAML examples, and pro tips"
  - "Each command section follows identical format across lines 127-470 of README.md"
  - "Documentation is accurate - all README descriptions align with actual template behavior"
  - "Current 'What it does' sections are technical and implementation-focused (8-10 numbered steps showing internal mechanics)"
  - "File structure examples and key features add significant length without improving user understanding"
  - "Pro tips provide practical optimization advice and are well-received"

architectural_decisions:
  - pattern: "Consistent Documentation Structure"
    description: "All 5 commands follow identical section format for predictability"
    rationale: "Users can quickly scan any command section knowing structure is consistent"

  - pattern: "Technical Implementation Details"
    description: "Current 'What it does' sections explain internal mechanics with 8-10 numbered steps"
    rationale: "Originally designed to show transparency but creates cognitive overhead for users who just want to trust the system"

tldr:
  - "README documents 5 slash commands (lines 127-470) with technical implementation details"
  - "User wants simplified format: keep purpose, usage, 1-3 examples, pro tips"
  - "Remove: YAML file structure examples, key features sections"
  - "Change: 'What it does' from technical steps to high-level user-perspective description"
  - "Goal: Users should understand value proposition quickly to decide if they trust the system"

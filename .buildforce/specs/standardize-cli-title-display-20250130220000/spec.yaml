name: "Standardize CLI Title Display"
type: feature
status: draft
created: "2025-01-30"
last_updated: "2025-01-30"

summary: |
  Standardize all CLI title displays to use the same 3-line format (figlet title, tagline, instruction)
  currently shown in --help, ensuring a cohesive user experience across all CLI entry points.

# INTENT / PROBLEM STATEMENT

problem: |
  Currently, the CLI has inconsistent banner/title displays. The `--help` command shows a polished
  3-line format with figlet-generated "BUILDFORCE" title, tagline, and instruction message. However,
  all other commands (examples, check, upgrade, init) use a 2-line format via `showBanner()` function
  that shows ASCII art title and tagline, missing the instruction line. This inconsistency creates
  a fragmented user experience and breaks the cohesive visual identity of the CLI tool.

motivation: |
  Consistent visual presentation across all CLI entry points builds user trust and creates a
  professional, polished experience. The 3-line format already exists and works well in `--help`,
  so standardizing all commands to use it will unify the CLI's visual identity. Additionally,
  including the instruction line ("Check our example workflows by typing `buildforce examples`")
  in all commands increases discoverability of workflow examples, which is valuable for user
  onboarding and adoption.

# GOALS

primary_goals:
  - Standardize all CLI title displays to use identical 3-line format (figlet title, tagline, instruction)
  - Eliminate code duplication by centralizing banner rendering in a shared function
  - Maintain visual consistency with existing --help banner appearance

secondary_goals:
  - Increase discoverability of workflow examples by showing instruction line everywhere
  - Remove unused BANNER constant after migration to clean up codebase

# REQUIREMENTS

functional_requirements:
  - FR1: All CLI commands (examples, check, upgrade, init) must display the same 3-line banner format as --help
  - FR2: Banner must show figlet-generated "BUILDFORCE" title (white, centered)
  - FR3: Banner must show tagline "Context-first Spec-Driven Development framework" (mint green #3EB489, centered)
  - FR4: Banner must show instruction "Check our example workflows by typing `buildforce examples`" (dim gray, centered)
  - FR5: Default init command help (when no args/flags) must use the same 3-line format
  - FR6: All banner displays must be centered based on terminal width

non_functional_requirements:
  - NFR1: Banner rendering must be performant (no noticeable delay when commands start)
  - NFR2: Banner format must be responsive to terminal width changes
  - NFR3: Code changes must maintain backward compatibility (no breaking changes to function signatures if possible)
  - NFR4: Banner rendering logic must be DRY (no duplication across files)

# SCOPE

in_scope:
  - Update `showBanner()` function in `src/lib/interactive.ts` to use figlet and include instruction line
  - Replace `renderBannerForHelp()` in `src/cli.ts` to use shared banner function
  - Remove duplicate banner code from `src/cli.ts` (lines 321-337)
  - Update all command calls to use new banner format (should be automatic via function update)
  - Verify all CLI entry points show consistent 3-line format

out_of_scope:
  - Changing the actual text content of title, tagline, or instruction message
  - Adding new banner variants or customization options
  - Modifying other CLI output formatting (help boxes, etc.)
  - Adding configuration options to disable banner
  - Changing color scheme (mint green, white, dim gray remain the same)

# DESIGN PRINCIPLES

design_principles:
  - "DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Centralize banner logic in one function, eliminate duplication"
  - "Consistency First: All entry points must show identical format for cohesive UX"
  - "Backward Compatible: Minimize breaking changes to existing function signatures"
  - "Progressive Enhancement: Build on existing --help implementation pattern"

# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

acceptance_criteria:
  - AC1: Running `buildforce --help` shows 3-line banner (figlet title, tagline, instruction)
  - AC2: Running `buildforce examples` shows 3-line banner matching --help format
  - AC3: Running `buildforce check` shows 3-line banner matching --help format
  - AC4: Running `buildforce upgrade` shows 3-line banner matching --help format
  - AC5: Running `buildforce init` (with no args) shows 3-line banner matching --help format
  - AC6: Running `buildforce` (default init) shows 3-line banner matching --help format
  - AC7: All banners are centered based on terminal width
  - AC8: No duplicate banner rendering code exists in codebase
  - AC9: All banner displays use figlet (not ASCII art BANNER constant)

# ASSUMPTIONS & DEPENDENCIES

assumptions:
  - figlet package is already installed and available (used in --help)
  - Terminal width detection (process.stdout.columns) is reliable
  - Users want consistent banner experience across all commands
  - Instruction line ("Check our example workflows...") is appropriate for all commands

dependencies:
  internal:
    - figlet: "Package already used for --help banner generation"
    - chalk: "Package already used for color formatting"
  external:
    - "No new external dependencies required"

# OPEN QUESTIONS

open_questions:
  # All resolved - instruction line will be same everywhere, BANNER constant will be removed

# NOTES

notes: |
  The current --help implementation (`renderBannerForHelp()`) provides the reference implementation.
  The goal is to extract this logic into a shared function that all commands can use, ensuring
  perfect visual consistency. The figlet font "ANSI Shadow" and color scheme (white title, mint
  green tagline, dim gray instruction) should be preserved exactly as they appear in --help.

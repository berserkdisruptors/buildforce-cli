name: "README v3 - Developer-Focused Documentation"
type: feature
status: draft
created: "2025-01-30"
last_updated: "2025-01-30"

summary: |
  Create a developer-focused README v3 that follows OSS best practices observed in successful CLI tools (bat, ripgrep, fd, fzf), eliminates marketing language, restores full command documentation inline, and positions Buildforce as a technical reference manual rather than a landing page.

# INTENT / PROBLEM STATEMENT

problem: |
  README-v2.md attempted to solve a marketing problem that doesn't exist for CLI tools targeting individual developers. It introduced several issues:
  - Reduced command documentation from 270 lines to 15 lines (95% reduction), killing discoverability
  - Added marketing language ("The Problem", "dramatically more effective") that reduces developer trust
  - Included FAQ and Enterprise/Security sections that feel defensive and off-target for individual developers
  - Positioned tool as SaaS product rather than technical utility
  - Installation appears too late (line 160) when developers need immediate action path

  Analysis of successful OSS CLI tools (bat, ripgrep, fd, fzf with 10k-68k stars) shows they:
  - Lead with visual proof (screenshots, benchmarks) not prose
  - Keep 100-200+ lines of inline command documentation
  - Have minimal "why use this" sections (1 sentence, not paragraphs)
  - Never have "The Problem" sections or defensive FAQs
  - Put installation early (within first 50 lines)
  - Optimize for technical depth over marketing appeal

motivation: |
  Developers evaluate CLI tools by asking "can it do X?" They need comprehensive inline documentation to make that assessment without clicking away. The README should be a reference manual that happens to market itself through utility and technical depth, not a marketing page with reduced documentation.

  The proposed v3 structure addresses user's concern about "too salesy" while maintaining v2's improved organizational flow. It combines:
  - Technical depth from original README
  - Structural clarity from v2
  - Zero marketing fluff
  - Developer-first presentation

# GOALS

primary_goals:
  - Create README that converts developers through technical depth and utility, not marketing language
  - Restore full command documentation inline (200+ lines) so developers can evaluate tool capabilities without leaving README
  - Follow observable patterns from successful OSS CLI tools (bat, ripgrep, fd, fzf)
  - Position Buildforce as technical reference manual, not SaaS product
  - Implement user's proposed 13-section structure while avoiding v2's pitfalls

secondary_goals:
  - Reduce time-to-first-action (installation within first 100 lines, ideally 50)
  - Add visual proof element (demo output, terminal examples)
  - Maintain content reusability from v2 where appropriate (Contributing, Support & Community, License sections)
  - Balance brevity with completeness (target 600-800 lines, 70% code examples and technical detail)

# REQUIREMENTS

functional_requirements:
  - FR1: Implement 13-section structure as specified by user (Title, One-liner, What is Buildforce, Why context-first, Comparison table, Quick Start, How it works, Commands breakdown, Supported agents, Contributing, Support & Community, License, Star the project)
  - FR2: Restore full command documentation inline with 30-40 lines per command covering purpose, usage, examples, output, key features (total 200-250 lines for 6 commands)
  - FR3: Create "What is Buildforce?" section (3-5 sentences max) blending problem statement with solution, avoiding v2's verbose "The Problem" section
  - FR4: Create "Why context-first?" section (4-6 sentences) explaining context persistence value proposition without marketing language
  - FR5: Update comparison table from v2 to focus on "Traditional AI Assistant" vs "AI Assistant + Buildforce" with concrete technical differences
  - FR6: Rename "Try It in 2 Minutes" to "Quick Start" with both global install and npx usage examples, positioned early (target line 80-120)
  - FR7: Create "How It Works" section as critical pedagogical step that delivers the "aha" moment before detailed command docs. Must include: (a) visual workflow representation showing command progression, (b) brief explanation of what happens at each step in the workflow, (c) 3 concrete scenarios demonstrating different entry points (basic /spec+/build, full workflow /research+/spec+/build+/complete, manual context /research+/document). This section bridges the gap between "what is Buildforce" and "how do I use each command" by showing the slash command orchestration pattern that distinguishes Buildforce from typical CLI tools.
  - FR8: Include AI assistants table from v2 showing 11 supported assistants with configuration folders
  - FR9: Reuse Contributing, Support & Community, and License sections from v2 verbatim
  - FR10: Add "Star the Project" call-to-action section at end (from v2)

non_functional_requirements:
  - NFR1: Total length 600-800 lines (comparable to fd, fzf) with 70% technical content (examples, commands, options)
  - NFR2: Zero marketing language - no "dramatically", "revolutionizing", "game-changing", "The Problem" sections, defensive FAQs
  - NFR3: Scannability - use tables, bullet lists, code blocks liberally; minimize prose paragraphs
  - NFR4: Developer trust signals - technical depth, accurate command documentation, real examples, no adjective inflation
  - NFR5: GitHub-optimized - proper heading hierarchy for auto-generated TOC, no manual TOC

# ASSUMPTIONS & DEPENDENCIES

assumptions:
  - User has access to both README.md (original) and README-v2.md for content reference
  - 11 AI assistants list and configuration details are current and accurate
  - npm package name (@buildforce/cli) and installation commands are stable
  - Contributing, Support & Community, and License sections from v2 are satisfactory and don't need modification
  - Command documentation accuracy can be verified against actual slash command template files in src/templates/commands/

dependencies:
  internal:
    - README-v2.md: "Source for reusable sections (Contributing, Support, License, Star CTA)"
    - README.md: "Original source for command documentation detail to restore"
    - src/templates/commands/*.md: "Ground truth for command features and usage"
    - package.json: "npm package metadata, version, repository URL"
    - .buildforce/context/slash-commands.yaml: "Command specifications and workflow details"
  external:
    - None

# OPEN QUESTIONS

open_questions:
  - Should we add a visual demo section placeholder for future screenshot/GIF addition?
  - Should comparison table include specific metrics (e.g., "Context persists across sessions" vs "Context lost after each session")?
  - Should "How It Works" examples show actual terminal output or just command sequences?
  - Should we include buildforce.json configuration file explanation in a separate section, or integrate it into Quick Start?

# NOTES

notes: |
  Key insights from successful OSS CLI tools analysis:
  - bat (49k stars): 80+ lines of usage examples inline, minimal "why" section
  - ripgrep (48k stars): 200+ lines technical docs, benchmarks establish trust
  - fd (34k stars): 100+ lines of examples, one-sentence value prop
  - fzf (68k stars): 150+ lines usage, screenshot before explanation

  These tools let metrics and technical depth speak for themselves rather than marketing copy.

  User's proposed structure is sound - it addresses the "too salesy" concern while maintaining organizational improvements from v2. The key is execution: filling sections with technical content not marketing prose.

  "Context-first" positioning is strong differentiation - it's technical and specific, not generic like "better workflow". The proposed structure elevates this to a dedicated section which is appropriate.

  Comparison table from v2 had good structure but needs content refinement to be technical rather than aspirational.

  CRITICAL DISTINCTION: Buildforce is NOT a typical CLI tool (like bat, fd, ripgrep) where commands are directly executed. Buildforce provides slash commands used INSIDE AI assistant conversations to orchestrate a workflow. This fundamental difference means:
  - Developers won't immediately understand how to use it just from seeing command syntax
  - "How It Works" section (Section 7) is the critical pedagogical moment
  - It must show workflow orchestration BEFORE diving into individual command docs
  - Without this "aha" moment, developers will read command docs without context and bounce
  - Section 7 bridges: "what is Buildforce" → "how commands work together" → "what each command does"

  This is similar to testing frameworks (Jest) showing a complete test file before explaining describe(), test(), expect() functions individually.

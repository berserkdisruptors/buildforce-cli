# Extraction Progress Template
# This file is generated by Context Manager for each extraction iteration.
# Extractors read this file to understand their tasks for the current iteration.
# File is EPHEMERAL - deleted after each iteration completes.

# Current extraction status
status: pending  # pending | in-progress | complete

# Iteration number (increments each extraction run)
iteration: 1

# Items to extract in this iteration
# Context Manager populates this based on user prompt or recommended_focus
target_items:
  - id: example-item
    name: Example Item
    current_depth: none      # none | shallow | moderate | deep
    target_depth: shallow    # Target depth for this iteration
    priority: high           # high | medium | low
    notes: ""                # Any context from previous iterations

# Verification criteria for this iteration
# These are SPECIFIC to the target items, not generic questions
# Extractors must answer these to complete the iteration
verification_criteria:
  - Can I explain the primary purpose of this item?
  - What are the main dependencies and relationships?
  - Are there any key design decisions to document?

# Tasks for the extractor to execute
# Extractors update task status as they work
tasks:
  - task: Analyze item structure and purpose
    status: pending          # pending | in-progress | complete
    findings: ""             # Populated by extractor

# Checkpoint for progress tracking
last_checkpoint: null        # ISO timestamp of last update

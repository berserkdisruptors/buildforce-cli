# Buildforce Architecture Context Index
# This file tracks architecture context files for your project.
# Architecture context captures WHAT exists - structural understanding of your codebase.

version: "2.0"

# ============================================================================
# ARCHITECTURE INDEX FIELD DOCUMENTATION
# ============================================================================
#
# Each context entry in the index has the following fields:
#
# REQUIRED FIELDS:
# ----------------
# - id (string, kebab-case):
#     Unique identifier matching the context filename (without .yaml extension)
#     Must be unique across all entries in this index
#     Example: "authentication", "build-command", "error-handling"
#
# - file (string):
#     Context filename (must match id field with .yaml extension)
#     Example: "authentication.yaml", "build-command.yaml"
#
# - type (string):
#     Must be "structural" for all entries in this index
#     This replaces the legacy type enum (module, feature, component, pattern)
#     Example: "structural"
#
# OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED FIELDS:
# ---------------------------------
# - description (string, max 100 chars):
#     Generic, stable one-liner describing WHAT this module/feature IS
#     Focus on its identity and purpose, not implementation details
#     Example: "User authentication system with JWT tokens and OAuth2 integration"
#
# - tags (array of strings):
#     Searchable keywords for discovery
#     Use relevant terms related to functionality, technology, domain
#     Example: [auth, security, jwt, oauth2]
#
# - related_context (array of context IDs, OPTIONAL):
#     Array of context IDs that are closely related to this context
#     Enables agents to discover related contexts through explicit cross-references
#
#     **When to populate:**
#       - Feature families (e.g., all slash commands reference slash-commands)
#       - Dependent modules (e.g., build-command depends on plan-template)
#       - Sibling features (e.g., research and document commands work together)
#
#     Example: [plan-template, iterate-plan-command, spec-command]
#
# ============================================================================
#
# MIGRATION NOTE:
# ---------------
# This index uses type: "structural" for all entries, replacing the legacy
# type enum (module, feature, component, pattern). The nature of what's
# documented is now captured through descriptive summaries rather than
# explicit type categorization.

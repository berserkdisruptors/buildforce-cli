# Buildforce Verification Context Index
# This file tracks verification context files for your project.
# Verification context answers: "HOW do I know it's right?"

version: "2.0"

# ============================================================================
# VERIFICATION INDEX FIELD DOCUMENTATION
# ============================================================================
#
# Each context entry in the index has the following fields:
#
# REQUIRED FIELDS:
# ----------------
# - id (string, kebab-case):
#     Unique identifier matching the context filename (without .yaml extension)
#     Must be unique across all entries in this index
#     Example: "project-verification-standards", "api-quality-standards"
#
# - file (string):
#     Context filename (must match id field with .yaml extension)
#     Example: "project-verification-standards.yaml"
#
# - type (string):
#     Must be "verification" for all entries in this index
#     Example: "verification"
#
# - source (enum):
#     How this verification context was populated
#     Valid values: mined | manual | hybrid
#       - mined: Derived from PR comment analysis by GitHub Action
#       - manual: Manually documented by the team
#       - hybrid: Combination of mining results with human curation
#     Example: "hybrid"
#
# OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED FIELDS:
# ---------------------------------
# - description (string, max 100 chars):
#     Brief description of what this verification context covers
#     Example: "Quality standards and review checklist for the project"
#
# - tags (array of strings):
#     Searchable keywords for discovery
#     Example: [quality, testing, review]
#
# ============================================================================
#
# CAPTURE MECHANISM:
# -----------------
# Verification context is primarily captured outside coding sessions:
#   - GitHub Action (PR Mining): Analyzes PR comments to extract patterns
#   - Manual Documentation: Team documents standards directly
#
# The CLI can READ verification context during /build for self-review,
# but does not typically WRITE it. This is different from other context types.
#
# ============================================================================

# Verification context entries
# All entries must have type: verification

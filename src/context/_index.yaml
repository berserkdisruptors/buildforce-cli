# Buildforce Context Repository Index
# This file serves as the entry point to your project's context repository.
# It points to three context type directories, each serving a different purpose.

version: "2.0"

# ============================================================================
# CONTEXT TAXONOMY OVERVIEW
# ============================================================================
#
# The context repository is organized into three directories, each aligned
# with the context taxonomy pillars that AI agents need most:
#
# 1. ARCHITECTURE (architecture/)
#    Answers: WHAT exists already?
#    Contains: Structural understanding of modules, features, and components
#    Used by: /buildforce.research, /buildforce.plan, /buildforce.build
#
# 2. CONVENTIONS (conventions/)
#    Answers: HOW do we do things here?
#    Contains: Coding standards, patterns, and practices
#    Used by: /buildforce.plan, /buildforce.build (validation)
#
# 3. VERIFICATION (verification/)
#    Answers: HOW do I know it's right?
#    Contains: Quality standards, test expectations, known risks
#    Used by: /buildforce.build (self-review), PR Review Actions
#
# For more details on the context taxonomy, see:
# https://buildforce.dev/concepts/context-repository
#
# ============================================================================
# NAVIGATING THE CONTEXT REPOSITORY
# ============================================================================
#
# Each context type directory contains:
#   - _schema.yaml: Field definitions and validation rules for context files
#   - _index.yaml: Registry of context files in that directory
#   - *.yaml: Individual context files following the schema
#
# To find context:
#   1. Determine what type of context you need (architecture, convention, verification)
#   2. Navigate to that directory's _index.yaml
#   3. Find relevant context files by id, tags, or description
#   4. Read the full context file for detailed information
#
# ============================================================================

# Context type directories
# Each directory is self-contained with its own schema and index
context_types:
  architecture:
    path: "architecture/"
    description: |
      Structural context about WHAT exists in the codebase.
      Contains understanding of modules, features, components, and their relationships.
      All entries have type: structural.
    index_file: "architecture/_index.yaml"
    schema_file: "architecture/_schema.yaml"

  conventions:
    path: "conventions/"
    description: |
      Convention context about HOW things are done here.
      Contains coding standards, architectural patterns, and project practices.
      All entries have type: convention with a sub_type for categorization.
    index_file: "conventions/_index.yaml"
    schema_file: "conventions/_schema.yaml"

  verification:
    path: "verification/"
    description: |
      Verification context about HOW to know if code is right.
      Contains quality standards, test expectations, review checklists, and known risks.
      All entries have type: verification with source field (mined, manual, hybrid).
    index_file: "verification/_index.yaml"
    schema_file: "verification/_schema.yaml"
